<td class="post-cell"><a name="23413"></a><p>I read some threads related to Shu case, for example that he took all the voids and illness of each people to save them but then Inori in some way she took them and die instead of Shu. And after that Shu becomes blind because Inori was like that before she dies?</p>

<p>I am not sure..</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">This is extremely late but I think giving this response is still needed as the other answer gave the implication that Inori is dead, which there is speculation that she is not. For more info, read this post, I know it's really long, but trust me, it changes your feelings regarding the ending. http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1408286</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; user23058 on 2016-03-28 22:28:47</span></div>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="23433"></a><p>During episode 22 after Shu defeats Gai and both he and Mana crystalize, Shu then uses both his original King power and Gai's power to absorb every single void and Apocalypse Virus remaining on the planet. After this action Shu becomes fully crystalized and has a vision of Inori offering him the Guilty Crown and Shu accepts. By this acceptance of the crown Shu and Inori switch places. A trade happens and Inori receives all of Shu's illness and he receives hers. ref(<a href="http://guiltycrown.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_22" rel="nofollow">Guilty Crown Wiki</a>) </p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="36166"></a><p>In the end Inori gave Shu her soul, Shu and Inori became one. Inori wanted Shu to live on which is why she gave her soul to him even though they can never meet again. Inori was blind before she gave her soul to Shu which explains why Shu is blind at the last part of ep 22.</p>
