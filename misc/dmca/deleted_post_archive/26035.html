<td class="post-cell"><a name="26035"></a><p>I've seen advice on the internet indicating that one should start watching Gungrave at episode 2, and possibly come back to episode 1 at some later point in the series.</p>

<p>Before I start watching this show, I would like to know whether this advice makes sense. In a spoiler-free way, can someone explain why I should skip episode 1? (Feel free to include more detailed explanations in a spoiler block.)</p>

<p>And should I come back to episode 1 at some later point in the series? </p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="26038"></a><p>The first episode is almost exactly like the eighteenth episode. What it does is confuse the viewer with out of context content in addition to spoiling a lot of the anime.</p>

<p>Many animes like to show an ambiguous later scene in the first episode, and then build towards that story line, like in Psycho-pass. Gungrave is an example of where this failed miserably. The episode is detailed to the point where it is just plain confusing and spoiled. </p>

<p>It's best to watch episode 1 after episode 17.</p>
