<td class="post-cell"><a name="38891"></a><p>In Code Geass season 2 episode 7, there is a song playing at 6:40.This is about the time when Lelouch breaks his phone and throws it away when Kallen calls him. I can't find the song in the OST and I'm pretty sure it has been featured elsewhere in the series as well.</p>

<p>EDIT: I also noticed it play in episode 8 at 12:27.Corrected season number.</p>
