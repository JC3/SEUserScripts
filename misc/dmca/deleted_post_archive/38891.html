<td class="post-cell"><a name="38891"></a><p>In Code Geass season 2 episode 7, there is a song playing at 6:40.This is about the time when Lelouch breaks his phone and throws it away when Kallen calls him. I can't find the song in the OST and I'm pretty sure it has been featured elsewhere in the series as well.</p>

<p>EDIT: I also noticed it play in episode 8 at 12:27.Corrected season number.</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">Are you talking about season 1 (R1) or season 2 (R2), either way I'm not hearing a song at any of those points, could you link me to the video you heard it on?</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Cory Krantz on 2017-03-07 08:39:50</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">season 2(R2), episode 7 just after lelouch breaks his phone, we hear this play in the background.This piece plays in multiple different places and i just happened to remember these two points.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Tac on 2017-03-12 10:10:02</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">What I found was it is not released as an OST yet. But it is probably a piano version of Yuukyou Seishunka by Ali Project.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; SuperHaker on 2017-03-30 21:54:27</span></div>
