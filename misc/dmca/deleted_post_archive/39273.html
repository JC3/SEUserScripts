<p>You will find it on youtube however the versions on youtube do not sound exactly like the version used in Fairy Tail, for that version I suggest that you find the fairy tail soundtrack online and download it because the version used in the show is an edited version. </p>

<div><span class="comment-text">@MineCraftSlayer, you'll need to look up the original soundtrack discography or check out something like Nipponsei. 
People only ever know OPs and EDs, so this question might go unanswered for a while. Harder to find insert songs, but you can. 
For example "Meteor"(ep 47) and "Akatsuki no Kuruma"(ep 40) were both insert songs in Gundam Seed, but if you'd asked about them then, someone would have points out the op/ed. Lol.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; VISQL on 2017-04-06 20:32:32</span></div>
