<td class="post-cell"><a name="18861"></a><p><em>Angel Beats!</em> is full of parodies, some are obvious, and some are not. The following parodies/homages have been identified:</p>

<p><strong>Episode 2</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserHallway" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Laser Hallway</a> is likely a homage to <em>Resident Evil</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Episode 3</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0zPvf.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Yuri crossing her fingers</a> (<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerTenting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">finger tenting</a>) is a parody of <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-gendo-pose" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Gendo Pose</a> from <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JhLB0l.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Takeyama's pi attack</a>, having the same effect as the Ring Tightening Mantra, might be a homage to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Journey to the West</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/isBng.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Takeyama's finger pointing</a> (and appearing from behind Yuri) is a parody of <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9XJOC.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Detective Conan</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s6ZrT.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Otonashi's first mosaic image of Angel's area</a> is clearly <em>Laputa: Castle in the Sky</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4vFs1.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Otonashi's second mosaic image of Angel's area</a> is clearly <em>Howl's Moving Castle</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>OVA Special: Hell's Kitchen</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Radio communications club is <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7WG77l.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ripping off</a> from <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/np1Dd.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>Apocalypse Now</em></a>.</li>
<li>This is a wild guess, but Girls Dead Monster might actually be a homage to Dead Girls, a four-girl music group in the <em>Red Garden</em> OVA. Granted, it is a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourGirlEnsemble" rel="nofollow noreferrer">common team combination</a>, but there are two more similarities between the two music groups: a former band member of GirlDeMo, Iwasawa, passed away (the second time) and left the team; a former schoolmate of the members of Dead Girls, Lise, who was murdered together with the four girls, also passed away (the second time) and left the team. Moreover, the demon, what Otonashi calls a <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yBiOHl.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"monster"</a>, that Hisako turned into resembles the <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/weSNXl.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">monsters</a> in <em>Red Garden</em>.</li>
</ul>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="18869"></a><p>The Knockin' On Heaven's Door image (Ep 12) could be a reference to the song of the same name by Bob Dylan.</p>

<p>I'm lead to believe this because a comment from <em>atlantiza</em> in this <strong><a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3108/what-is-tks-actual-name">question</a></strong> says that TK's nonsensical English phrases are song lyrics.</p>

<p>On a side note, there is also a movie called "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" and the "subtitle" of the Cowboy Bebop movie was "Knockin' on Heaven's Door".</p>

<p>I was looking to see if the pose was a parody of anyone and discovered that the <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856796/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">12th episode</a></strong> of Angel Beats is called "Knockin' on Heaven's Door", which according to the IMDb trivia, <em>is</em> named after the song. So I think that the pose is all TK.</p>

<p>The quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>TK:</strong> <em>[fighting the shadow monsters]</em> Knockin' on Heaven's Door. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Hinata:</strong> Hold on a minute. That's Bob Dylan. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Noda:</strong> But it matches the situation. </p>
</blockquote>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="18867"></a><p>Yuri's evil laugh (OVA Special) looks like Lelouch from Code Geass: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/j6vVBCb.jpg?1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">his signature arm position</a> and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/k8JIl8l.png?1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">his laugh</a>. I can't seem to be able to find any good quality image where he's laughing and doing his signature arm position at the same time, but you get the idea.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="18874"></a><p>The Attack in front of the moon (OVA Special) strongly reminds me of <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/935/Witchblade" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Witchblade</a>.</p>

<p>Angel slashing the shadows (Ep 11) looks like a reference to General Grievous from Star Wars (in his fight against Obi Wan on Utapau).</p>

<p>The Knockin' on Heaven's Door (Ep 12) is a reference to the Guns'n'Roses version, or rather to the Guns'n'Roses lead singer Axl Rose (who is blonde and often wears a red headband):</p>
