<td class="post-cell"><a name="2675"></a><p>According to MAL, the <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/4654/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index">former</a> is the parent story of the <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/6213/Toaru_Kagaku_no_Railgun">latter</a>, that appears described as a side story. However, I find no reference to these questions:</p>

<p><strong>Do both stories take place in the same universe?<br>
Are they somewhat dependent on each other?<br>
If so, in which order should the series be watched?</strong></p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="3055"></a><p>Chronologically, <em>Railgun</em> comes first. Then near the middle of <em>Railgun</em> (the Level Upper Arc), the events and timeline start to converge with <em>Index</em>.</p>

<p>For an example, in episode 17 of the <em>Railgun</em> anime, Komoe-sensei mentions how she likes all her students, even the ones that blow up her roof, which is probably a reference to when Index used Dragon's Breath (episode 6 of <em>Index</em>). </p>

<p>The manga gives a better frame of reference, since it gives a exact date (July 16th). 
So the events in <em>Railgun</em> begin 4 days before the Index novel (July 20th), where Touma first meets Index. Touma <a href="http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index%3aVolume1_Prologue">meets</a> Mikoto on the eve of July 19th. </p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun?from=Manga.ToAruKagakuNoRailgun">TV Tropes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The anime, however, violates this by adapting events from Volume 8 of the novels into the anime's first episode. As it stands, Chapters 18 to 39 occur around the time of Volume 3 in the novels, Chapter 40 is around volume 5, Chapters 41-42 and around volume 8 and Chapters 43-current take place around volume 9.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="2678"></a><p>Railgun is a non-canon spinoff using the characters and setting of Index.</p>

<p>by that definition:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I guess they take place in alternate universes.</p></li>
<li><p>They are indepedent besides setting and characters.</p></li>
<li><p>Watching both seasons of Index before Railgun is in my opinion for the better.</p></li>
