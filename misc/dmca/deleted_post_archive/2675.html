<td class="post-cell"><a name="2675"></a><p>According to MAL, the <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/4654/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index">former</a> is the parent story of the <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/6213/Toaru_Kagaku_no_Railgun">latter</a>, that appears described as a side story. However, I find no reference to these questions:</p>

<p><strong>Do both stories take place in the same universe?<br>
Are they somewhat dependent on each other?<br>
If so, in which order should the series be watched?</strong></p>

<div><span class="comment-text">I like both series. They each have their goods and bads. Index has a bit more of a convoluted and involved storyline, due to the encounters with magic and science, but is very funny in the ways that Touma interacts with Index. Railgun is more straight forward and clear cut. It is very action packed but is also funny. So, watch both.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; user4647 on 2014-04-24 20:15:45</span></div>

<div><span class="comment-text">While there are slight differences (as expected with different adaptations), there's nothing drastic that affects the continuity. E.g., in the novel Touma "slaps" away Mikoto's railgun, but in the manga he "catches" it. In the novel, the first hit that Touma lands on the Accelerator is a slap to his hand, but the Railgun manga he hits him square in the face.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; кяαzєя on 2013-02-27 14:54:34</span></div>

<div><span class="comment-text">Thanks to everyone who posted a comment. I started watching both of them at once, but then I couldn't keep up with majutsu no index. This helped me not freak out about not watching kagaku no railgun without anybody telling heavy spoilers. Thanks again!</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; user1995 on 2013-07-08 00:53:48</span></div>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="3055"></a><p>Chronologically, <em>Railgun</em> comes first. Then near the middle of <em>Railgun</em> (the Level Upper Arc), the events and timeline start to converge with <em>Index</em>.</p>

<p>For an example, in episode 17 of the <em>Railgun</em> anime, Komoe-sensei mentions how she likes all her students, even the ones that blow up her roof, which is probably a reference to when Index used Dragon's Breath (episode 6 of <em>Index</em>). </p>

<p>The manga gives a better frame of reference, since it gives a exact date (July 16th). 
So the events in <em>Railgun</em> begin 4 days before the Index novel (July 20th), where Touma first meets Index. Touma <a href="http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index%3aVolume1_Prologue">meets</a> Mikoto on the eve of July 19th. </p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun?from=Manga.ToAruKagakuNoRailgun">TV Tropes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The anime, however, violates this by adapting events from Volume 8 of the novels into the anime's first episode. As it stands, Chapters 18 to 39 occur around the time of Volume 3 in the novels, Chapter 40 is around volume 5, Chapters 41-42 and around volume 8 and Chapters 43-current take place around volume 9.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="2678"></a><p>Railgun is a non-canon spinoff using the characters and setting of Index.</p>

<p>by that definition:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I guess they take place in alternate universes.</p></li>
<li><p>They are indepedent besides setting and characters.</p></li>
<li><p>Watching both seasons of Index before Railgun is in my opinion for the better.</p></li>

<div><span class="comment-text">Just want to expand on their independence - You can watch only Index and it will make sense. You can also watch only Railgun and it will also make sense. I don't think any parts of their stories rely on the other's stories. Personally, I don't really enjoy Index, but I think Railgun is great. I know people who think the opposite. If you don't like one, you don't need to watch the other for fear of not understanding something in the one you like.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; atlantiza on 2013-02-26 23:32:04</span></div>

<div><span class="comment-text">Everything from the characters to plot in the Railgun series is canon to the main Index series, as the story was made by the author of the novels. This includes the Saten cameos appearance in the novels and "[Capacity Down](http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.com/wiki/Capacity_Down)" used on Accelerator in Volume 19 of the novels. This also works the other way with Railgun series. Everything that happens in the Railgun happen in the Railgun, hence why Eri and Harumi-sensei's students being cured are canon.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; кяαzєя on 2013-02-27 14:48:02</span></div>

<div><span class="comment-text">Being written by the same person doesn´t make it canon. Fate/Apocrypha is partially being written by Kinoku Nasu but it´s still not canon and instead an alternate universe. Even if they use props like the Capacity Down that were featured in Railgun, that doesn´t make Railgun canon.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Christian Aurig Frøkjær on 2013-02-27 16:40:15</span></div>
