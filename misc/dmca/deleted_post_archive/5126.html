<td class="post-cell"><a name="5128"></a><p>I had a listen to the OST for <em>Season 1</em> and the only song this sounds like is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=48QHhyBq8kw" rel="nofollow">Catch-22</a>. The quality difference is noticeable but some distinct sounds match. Unless my ears are deceiving me, ~<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=YqBoX5nZBFc#t=149" rel="nofollow">2:28</a> in <em>episode 8</em>  matches ~<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48QHhyBq8kw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m45s" rel="nofollow">1:45</a> of the song.</p>
