<td class="post-cell"><a name="11621"></a><p>There are lots of series out there called "Hidamari Sketch" -something and I'm not sure in which order to watch them. Can you help me out with that?</p>

<tr><td class="author-cell"><div class="author-card"><a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/191">Hakase</a><br><a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/11621">2014-07-03 03:47:37</a></div>
<tr><td class="score-cell" rowspan="2">6
<td class="post-cell"><a name="11627"></a><p>You might as well watch them in production/publishing order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hidamari Sketch</li>
<li>Hidamari Sketch (special)</li>
<li>Hidamari Sketch × 365 (TV) </li>
<li>Hidamari Sketch × 365 (special)</li>
<li>Hidamari Sketch × Hoshimittsu (TV) </li>
<li>Hidamari Sketch × Hoshimittsu (special) </li>
<li>Hidamari Sketch × SP (special) </li>
<li>Hidamari Sketch × Honeycomb (TV) (sequel)</li>
<li>Hidamari Sketch: Sae/Hiro Sotsugyō-hen (OAV)</li>
</ol>

<p>(listing from <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6811" rel="nofollow">ANN's page</a>.  Everything except the last OAV is <a href="http://www.hulu.com/search?q=Hidamari+Sketch" rel="nofollow">on Hulu</a> - the specials are part of the previous main season)</p>

<p>The problem is that <em>episodes</em> aren't completely in chronological order.  There're two groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hidamari Sketch + Hidamari Sketch × 365 (Yuno &amp; Miyako year 1)</li>
<li>× Hoshimittsu + × SP + × Honeycomb + Sae/Hiro Sotsugyō-hen (Yuno &amp; Miyako year 2)</li>
</ul>

<p>Episodes in the first groups are less ordered.  Episodes in the second group are more in order, but also have some episodes that chronologically take place during the first group.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="31521"></a><p>I completely agree with @Clockwork-Muse' suggestion that, if you're a first time watcher, release order is definitely the way to go.<br/>
The show was made in that order and cues in later episodes (even if set in the past) will have no effect if you haven't seen what they're referencing from a previous ep.</p>

<p>However, for everyone else that, like me, rocked up at this question because you're generally curious about what the actual order might be <sup>(instead of just being ushered away with <em><code>don't you worry about that</code></em>)</sup>, I'm writing this for you.<br/>
This is no Haruhi, but I don't doubt that it'd be cool to go chronological for a rewatch of the show, get a new perspective and watch the characters grow together.</p>

<p><sub><strong>Year</strong> refers to the year of Yuno being at Hidamari. The first entry predates this. If <strong>Episode</strong> contains the <em>SP</em> prefix it means it is of the specials associated with that season, and if it has an <em>A</em> or <em>B</em> suffix it means it is only talking about the first/second half of that episode respectively!</sub></p>

<p>I found <a href="http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1337297" rel="noreferrer">this thread</a> where <code>Viteracf</code> has listed the order of the ep's for all four seasons! I tidied up his table [a lot] but you're gonna wanna consult his version if you want his notes on specific entries in the table (like why he put X before Y, or to see an uncovered anachronistic mistake).</p>

<p><sub><code>Centent</code> <a href="http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=301911" rel="noreferrer">also made a list</a> before that shows things in a slightly differing order, but doesn't regard all the seasons and could be at odds due to concerns already explained in the notes I mentioned earlier. Check them out if you feel the need</sub></p>
