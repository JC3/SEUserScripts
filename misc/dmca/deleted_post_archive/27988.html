<td class="post-cell"><a name="27988"></a><p>At the end of each episode, there is a preview of the next episode. What is the song that plays when they preview the next episode? It also plays in the very beginning of episode 15 of the new <em>Fairy Tail</em> 2014, I think that makes it episode 190 in the total running.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="28025"></a><p>The track that you're referring to is a bit unclear.</p>

<p>The pre-2014 preview music is different from the 2014+ preview music, and the music at the <em>very</em> beginning of 2014 episode 15 (the track <em>before</em> the theme song itself) is different from those two.</p>

<p>However, I notice that the track that plays immediately <em>after</em> the theme song in 2014 episode 15 is the same one as the one that plays during the 2014+ previews.</p>

<p>If this is the track that you are referring to, then the name of the song is</p>

<p>"<strong>Fairy Tail Main Theme 2014 (FAIRY TAIL メインテーマ 2014)</strong>" </p>

<p>(The Katakana as Romaji is "mein teimu" i.e. "main theme"). </p>

<p>It is track 1 on disk 1 of the album "Fairy Tail Sound Collection" by Yasuharu Takanashi (the fifth original soundtrack for Fairy Tail if you don't count the movie soundtrack).</p>

<p>I believe that I have supplied enough information for you to look up the track. I am hesitant to link to a Youtube video because I have noticed that Fairy Tail OST videos get taken down due to copyright violations very quickly and frequently so I don't want to provide an invalid link.</p>
