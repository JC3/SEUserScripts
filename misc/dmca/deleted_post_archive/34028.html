<td class="post-cell"><a name="34028"></a><p>I am looking to add the complete set of Wolf's Rain to my anime collection, however after shopping around on E-Bay I see the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/172189579429?lpid=82&amp;chn=ps&amp;ul_noapp=true" rel="nofollow">Wolf's Rain for over $300</a></p>

<p>This is a pretty common price-point for Wolf's Rain, I constantly see that this series is starting at over $300. Why is this? From what I understand Wolf's Rain was never really a huge hit. So why does it cost so much to obtain a legitimate copy?</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="34029"></a><p>You're looking at the original run of <em>Wolf's Rain</em>, which is no longer in production, and as such is subject to secondhand supply and demand price increases.</p>

<p>I recommend that you look into the <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/releases.php?id=5318" rel="nofollow">Wolf's Rain - Complete Collection Limited Edition DVD Set</a> released in 2005. This set started at 149.99 and is listed on the related auctions on the link you provided to eBay for $195, a ~25% increase from its original price.</p>
