<td class="post-cell"><a name="3749"></a><p>Aiura's opening has lots of crabs. Over half of the frames have crabs somewhere, and it has lots of crab-themed parodies, including of CNN and Apple. However, I haven't seen any crabs anywhere in the series other than that (up to episode 5). How are crabs significant to the series (if at all), and why were they featured so prominently in the OP?</p>

<p>I was not able to find this on youtube, but Crunchyroll is streaming the series. Here's the <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/aiura/episode-1-the-day-before-622205" rel="nofollow noreferrer">first episode</a>; the OP lasts until 1:00.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="5659"></a><p>It may actually be a layered joke on the title referring to a Japanese battle. First "Aiura" is pronounced the same way as "iUra", like an apple product, hence Steve Jobs in the OP. On the other hand the Tale of Heike says that the spirits of samurai who fell during the battle of Dan-no-Ura are carried by Heike crabs, and that's why their backs sort of look like a human face. That explains why there are crabs everywhere in the OP, which happen to also be linked with Steve Jobs since he died from cancer.
Thanks 4chan for this explanation : <a href="https://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/87335497/#87336503" rel="nofollow">https://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/87335497/#87336503</a> <a href="https://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/87872828/#87880558" rel="nofollow">https://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/87872828/#87880558</a></p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="4191"></a><p>I've seen 11 episodes of this anime; so far, the only crab that has appeared has been in a dream. I'd say that the crabs in the OP have nothing to do with the series.</p>

<p>The lyrics in the OP are about food, and the most common word in the song is "kani" (「カニ」), meaning "crab". During some of the frames of the video, there are crab tins with the word "Cancer" on them, but neither cancer nor Steve Jobs are mentioned in the song. The song does mention sexual violence at the start, and at the end, the chorus speaks about the "recipe" (perhaps something to do with food?) being "shit"...</p>

<p>In summary, the crabs do not appear to be significant at all; the OP is just very random.</p>
