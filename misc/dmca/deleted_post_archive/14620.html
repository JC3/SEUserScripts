<p>Is there more content past episode 25, and would there be more content to continue the series?</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="14728"></a><p>First of all, the novel version of "From the new world" is not a light novel.
I think it's a hard SF novel, instead of a light novel.</p>

<p>Yes, the 25 episodes of the anime covered the whole novel.</p>

<p>But there is a new series "New world zero year" that is running in a novel magazine. It has not been turned into a book yet. This series talks about the story before "From the new world".</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="14722"></a><p>There's no content "past episode 25", per se - the novel<sup>1</sup> ends just where the anime does, with Saki putting Squealer out of his misery, and finishing with a mention of the sign in the academy that reads 「想像力こそが、すべてを変える」 ("Imagination can change everything"). As such, there isn't any content on which one could base a sequel. </p>

<p>However, it isn't quite the case that the anime covered all the material in the novel - clocking in at around 950 pages of dense prose<sup>2</sup>, the novel contained many bits and pieces that didn't make it into the anime. </p>

<p>Some of this is probably because of restrictions on the kinds of content that can be shown on TV - e.g. somewhere around what would be episode 8, Saki witnesses Satoru and Shun having sex, and this is described in the novel in great detail (though not in a salacious way). </p>

<p>Most omissions, though, were probably just because of constraints on the amount of time available to the anime - <em>Shinsekai Yori</em> is an incredibly detail-rich story, and translating all that detail to the screen would require far more than just 25 episodes of anime. Remember how we got nearly a full episode of infodump from the false minoshiro in episode 4? That's the cut-down-for-TV version of that scene. In the novel, the false minoshiro speaks for around twice as long. </p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> Do note that <em>Shinsekai Yori</em> is an actual novel, not a light novel.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> In the one-volume edition, anyway.</p>
