<td class="post-cell"><a name="20205"></a><p>It seems that in the anime, the God only brought sorrow but not peace to people, and showed no mercy to those on earth.</p>

<p>Is Junketsu no Maria anti-Christian or something? Is it trying to depict Christian god as a brutal god?</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">From an "in-topic" point of view, I think this question is opinion driven. Going completely off topic, I don't see how a story where the christian god brings sorrow and general nuisances is that far away from what is told about him.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; ThCP on 2015-03-20 22:50:33</span></div>
