<p>In Outbreak Company (of which I saw whole 3 episodes) there was lots of references to other anime and manga. During those 3 episodes Myucel was introduced to many manga series and there was one she liked the most. While I was able to name most of other references I encountered, I wasn't able to identify that particular one. Does anyone know the name of the actual manga?</p>

<p>Edit: The scene was in episode 2 around 21min 39s</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">@nhahtdh It was in episode 2 around 21:39 (at least in the stream I found online). She doesn't say the name or anything, but a few pages are visible.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; jahu on 2015-03-24 19:32:14</span></div>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="23041"></a><p>It looks similar to <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastard!!" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Bastard!!</a></em> the child being a child Arshes Nei, a half human, half Dark Elf who was kept as a slave by the Wood Elves, Dark Schneider (the tall guy) found her after she was abandoned by her tribe.</p>

<p>However that's not her favorite manga. According to the eyecatch from the second half of episode 12, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Ajikko" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>Mister Ajikko</em></a>:</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">Can confirm it's supposed to be Bastard! the cover of the book is called BL!tard or something similar - and in the MVM licensed version it explicitly states that it's a reference to Bastard! if you are watching the subbed version</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Toshinou Kyouko on 2015-10-20 20:16:19</span></div>
