<p>In Outbreak Company (of which I saw whole 3 episodes) there was lots of references to other anime and manga. During those 3 episodes Myucel was introduced to many manga series and there was one she liked the most. While I was able to name most of other references I encountered, I wasn't able to identify that particular one. Does anyone know the name of the actual manga?</p>

<p>Edit: The scene was in episode 2 around 21min 39s</p>

<p>However that's not her favorite manga. According to the eyecatch from the second half of episode 12, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Ajikko" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>Mister Ajikko</em></a>:</p>
