<td class="post-cell"><a name="31806"></a><p>In the anime series K-ON! there is a BGM used quite frequently but I can't find it anywhere. It appears a lot throughout the anime but not in the movie. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>Season 1</p>

<ul>
<li>episode 8: 8:17 ~ 8:48</li>
<li>episode 9: 10:47 ~ 11:16</li>
</ul>

<p>Season 2</p>

<ul>
<li>episode 1: 14:20 ~ 15:55</li>
<li>episode 2: 13:55 ~ 14:57</li>
</ul>

<p>These are selected at random and the time might vary a bit depending where you watch it. The hyperlink: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1ew48VGOQPZRzN4Zl8zUmVjYWs/view" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1ew48VGOQPZRzN4Zl8zUmVjYWs/view</a> leads to google drive which has the BGM. The file is an abstract from season 2, episode 1. Please help me find this song.</p>

K-ON! Original Soundtrack, track #33</p>
