<td class="post-cell"><a name="5877"></a><p>What does Captain Kurotsuchi do to bring Nemu back to consciousness after her spirit particles have been absorbed by Szayelaporro? </p>

<p>I remember Ishida saying that it couldn't be aired. what exactly did he do? </p>

<p>You can watch the scene <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7whfxhAqSs" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="5878"></a><p>The manga doesn't explicitly state what Mayuri did, and Uryuu makes the same remark.</p>

<p>However, it seems very likely that Mayuri fiddled with Nemu's <em>"reset button"</em><sup>1</sup>, based on her moaning (see screenshot below), and his remark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can't even understand something that simple by looking at it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He later derides Uryuu and Renji for reaching wrong conclusions, and calls them laymen who do not understand his technology. This suggests that he might have given Nemu something <em>like</em> a Tantric Massage. Laymen watching it in our world would reach exactly the same wrong conclusion. </p>

<p>I know the above theory is a speculation, but this is as much evidence I can provide to support it. I guess we won't know any more of what he did for the reason Uryuu mentions.</p>
