<td class="post-cell"><a name="27827"></a><p>I searched everywhere to find this piece. I even tried the android app called Shazam.</p>

<p>It wasn't long enough to be recognized by Shazam. I'm talking about episode 296.</p>

<p>The track starts at 21:48 (when Franky shows up). <a href="http://www.viz.com/anime/streaming/one-piece-episode-294/5834/sub" rel="nofollow">Here</a>'s a link to the episode.</p>

<p>It's the scene where Franky shoots Chopper.</p>

<p>Could you guys please help me out? This piece really inspires me.</p>
