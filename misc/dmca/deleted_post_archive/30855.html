<td class="post-cell"><a name="30855"></a><p>I love <em>Natsume's Book of Friends</em> and have been watching its anime adaptation since it was aired in 2008. The second season was aired in 2009, and then came a long wait until 2011/2012 where the third and fourth season came.</p>

<p>Looking from the pattern, it seems there were roughly 2-3 years between season pairs, so I thought it would came around 2014/2015... unfortunately, there was no news about it.</p>

<p>Is there any official news when Natsume's Book of Friends will get season 5?</p>
