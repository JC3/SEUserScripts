<td class="post-cell"><a name="23627"></a><p><a href="https://instaud.io/9EF" rel="nofollow">This</a> track plays toward the end of <em>Refrain</em>, when</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Riki and Rin find themselves back at the bus crash site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-3rGgVG8QI" rel="nofollow">this</a> track plays in the common route whenever Riki chooses to play with Masato.</p>

<p>For some reason, neither of these tracks can be found in the <em>Little Busters!</em> Original Soundtrack - I listened through the entire thing and could not find either of them. </p>

<p>Is there perhaps another album with these tracks on it? </p>

<p>Is there a reason these tracks were excluded from the Original Soundtrack, which for all intents and purposes should contain all music used in the game? Did the folks at Key mess up, or were these tracks deemed unworthy of a spot on the soundtrack?  </p>

<p>Can someone find out what either of these are called, or are they just unnamed tracks excluded from the rest of the soundtrack for some reason?</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="24043"></a><p>After mulling it over for a bit, the best answer I can come up with is that the tracks simply <strong>aren't musically complex enough</strong> compared to the other songs in the soundtrack, where musical complexity can be defined principally as variance in  <strong>theme</strong>.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed while listening to the soundtrack was that, despite the looping nature of background music in visual novels, each track was treated as its own song with a distinct beginning and end, with few exceptions. By listening to the version of the song on the soundtrack, you can usually hear endings that weren't included in the version that played in-game because otherwise the song wouldn't be able to loop smoothly and continuously. Some of the character themes (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUIdaCm5Ooo" rel="nofollow">Haruka's</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENbgpg8tPy8" rel="nofollow">Kud's</a>) lack resolutions and simply repeat and fade out after a while, but they still have varied structures that make them interesting to listen to. </p>

<p>For example, we do a quick and dirty analysis of Haruka's leitmotif (timestamps from the YouTube link):</p>

<ul>
<li>0:00 - Theme A </li>
<li>0:36 - Bridge A</li>
<li>0:53 - Theme B</li>
<li>1:30 - Theme C</li>
<li>1:47 - Theme A with added melody</li>
<li>2:23 - Bridge B</li>
<li>2:25 - Bridge A</li>
<li>2:43 - Theme B with varied percussion</li>
<li>3:01 - Theme C</li>
<li>3:19 - Theme A with same added melody</li>
<li>3:54 - Bridge B</li>
</ul>

<p>And from there the song repeats from the beginning. This song, like every other song on the <em>Official Soundtrack</em>, has a handful of different themes and melodies that makes it more than just a catchy jingle. On the other hand, the two tracks in question contain only one theme. Masato's song at least varies the melody on top of an eight-bar blues, but the track from Refrain is only a 27-second loop with one melody and two different chords. </p>

<p>The lack of musical depth reflects less effort put into the songs, which makes sense when you consider the context in which they are played. The songs on the <em>Original Soundtrack</em> will be heard dozens of times over the course of a playthrough, so having them become stale could ruin the gameplay experience. On the other hand, the two tracks excluded from the soundtrack will be played a handful of times at best in one playthrough, and they play during relatively short scenes. I imagine many other visual novels do the same thing - token jingles that play every so often are excluded from the official soundtrack because in the end, they're more of a sound effect than a song.</p>
