I'm looking for where it was played in the anime.</p>

<p>The title says "Saijaku VS Saikyou (最弱 VS 最強)," which translates to "Weakest vs Strongest," but I don't seem to hear it in Touma vs Accelerator's battle.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="32261"></a><p>this song was featured on the Railgun S OST but it first appeared in "a certain magical index", episode 14 which was actually titled the same as the song, "strongest vs weakest", viewable here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NV2fR2cdRQ" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NV2fR2cdRQ</a>
but since your post does request when it appears in relevance to the Railgun series that would be episode 4 when Touma is fighting Misaka under the bridge at night. here's a clip of it directly from funimation's official channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lEtG-CJ9IY" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lEtG-CJ9IY</a> 
in the Railgun S series it was swapped for the soundtrack from OST volume 2 #16 "Ketsui to kakugo" in the Touma vs Accelerator fight which took place in episode 15.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="30415"></a><p>It plays when Accelerator is fighting Touma(In Saijaku vs Saikyou E14). Forward to around <strong>4 minute 30 second</strong> mark and you'll see it's not very emphatic but yeah gives the fight some taste.</p>
