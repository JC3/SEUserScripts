<td class="post-cell"><a name="9887"></a><p>I am looking for the name of a song in Attack on Titans that occurs during the scene when Eren takes a big rock to the hole in the wall. I don't know exactly what episode it is but at the beginning of that episode, the song is played.</p>

<p>Does anyone know the name of the song played during this scene and where I can legally buy or listen to this song?</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="9890"></a><p>You can buy it at Amazon. <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00CAL4LEI" rel="nofollow">This is the Audio CD</a> and it has the full OST of Attack on Titan.</p>

<p>The song title is "Call Your Name" (track #15) with vocals by mpi &amp; CASG</p>

<p>You can see it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb4i4gA-ssk" rel="nofollow">here</a>. But I suggest you buy it since this link could easily disappear.</p>
