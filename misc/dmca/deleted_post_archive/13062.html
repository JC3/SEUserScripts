<td class="post-cell"><a name="13062"></a><p>Is there a special reason for this name? I have watched it up to episode 3 but I still don't know why it's called Dramatical Murder.</p>

<p>If it won't spoil anything, please give me an explanation.</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">Technically you might want to play the VN. I played it and there are some different routes I have played such as the Koujaku bad ending, otherwise I don't think it was mentioned but that just gives me an excuse to play it again. xD</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Izumi-reiLuLu on 2014-07-26 22:00:19</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">Actually, telling you would spoil something big from toward the end of the VN.　Not sure how they'll go about it in the show.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; user7743 on 2014-07-26 22:11:39</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">@Konorai use the spoiler markdown `&gt;! spoiler here` for spoiler content.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; кяαzєя on 2014-07-26 22:26:17</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">@Krazer it was converted from a post, so he can't edit it (I think)</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Hakase on 2014-07-27 03:16:04</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">@user1306322 Krazer was telling Konorai to rewrite a complete answer to the question with spoilers hidden behind spoiler markup; just saying something is a spoiler doesn't count as an answer. The post can still be edited by anyone who can see it, though posting a new answer would presumably also be fine. The comment can't be edited though.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Logan M on 2014-07-27 03:23:05</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">@アズーサ oh so its based on a visual novel didn't know that so i looked it up and am wondering will the VN be enjoyable for a non yaoi fan.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; NoLifeKing on 2014-07-27 10:46:54</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">@NoLifeKing- I would suggest playing just Ddmd rather than re:connect first since re:connect has got kinda hardcore yaoi and stuff where as just the first one in my opinion just had a lot of action and only like one yaoi scene but it depends on the route chosen I guess. xD</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Izumi-reiLuLu on 2014-07-27 10:53:18</span></div>
