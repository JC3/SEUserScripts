<div><span class="comment-text">I can't give an authoritative answer as I don't think the creators have ever confirmed this, but having read the VNs I believe the meanings of the two sequel's titles are pretty obvious - labyrinth I think refers to Yuuji's past and the plots/conspiracies that have developed around him, which become's critical in the third VN, the eden of grisaia. The meaning of 'eden' in the third VN is very straightforward but is also a spoiler.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Bron on 2015-04-18 22:21:52</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">@Bron yes, the Eden in Grisaia no Rakuen is very straightforward... also, can you move your comment into an answer? it is good enough.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Mindwin on 2015-04-20 15:02:54</span></div>
