<td class="post-cell"><a name="21245"></a><p>I am trying to find the name / info on the French rap song played at 21:30 of "The Irregular at Magic High School" episode 17.</p>

<p>Does anyone know anything about it?
Is there a database that holds the music credits of anime?</p>

<p>I have googled everywhere and even shazam'd the song on my iPhone but did not find anything .</p>

<p>Any insight will be great</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">Ero, Hashirama, thanks a bunch.. this is the song i am looking for.  i will mark this answered.  but do you happen to know the credits, i.e. what group made that song?  Amazon.com has "Framemain Rockfeir" as the artist for the OST2 album.  i am not sure if he is also the artist for this particular song.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Fawzi Masri on 2015-05-05 16:14:08</span></div>

<div><span class="comment-text">@FawziMasri I have no idea who "Framemain Rockfeir" is, but there is no person of that name [credited on the album](http://vgmdb.net/db/covers.php?do=view&amp;cover=211196). The vocalist for Metaphore 2 was IGOR (also the lyricist). The composer was Iwasaki Taku (same as the rest of the album).</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; senshin on 2015-05-05 20:26:54</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">@HashiramaSenju I removed the Amazon link you included because it is almost certainly illicit - full anime OSTs are almost never available for download on Amazon US, never mind singles. This "Framemain Rockfeirr" person seems to be some sort of scammer or something.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; senshin on 2015-05-05 20:28:25</span></div>
