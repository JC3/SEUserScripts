<td class="post-cell"><a name="23420"></a><p>I recently watched "Aldnoah.Zero" and started with "Aldnoah.Zero (2015)". I was wondering about one of the main elements in this anime.</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>Aldnoah</strong> is something that was found on Mars ("Vers" as it's called by the Martians) and is something old from an ancient civilization no one knows much about. They power up their "weapon systems" (mechs) with this thing too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What is Aldnoah really?</strong> Is it some sort of stone, or some sort of energy? If it were just energy, they wouldn't have so advanced weapon systems, or not?</p>

<p>Where does the "Zero" in the name come from?</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="38734"></a><p>I believe Aldnoah refers to the power/energy itself. "Aldnoah.Zero" or "Aldnoah Zero" is never named or stated in-series. It could just be meant as a cool title, but I like to imagine it refers to the Terrans who fight without Aldnoah or other Versian weapons/technology. ;)</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="23538"></a><p>Aldnoah is the technology and power source the Martians use. The "Zero" part of the title is likely just there to make the title seem more appealing.</p>
