<td class="post-cell"><a name="23420"></a><p>I recently watched "Aldnoah.Zero" and started with "Aldnoah.Zero (2015)". I was wondering about one of the main elements in this anime.</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>Aldnoah</strong> is something that was found on Mars ("Vers" as it's called by the Martians) and is something old from an ancient civilization no one knows much about. They power up their "weapon systems" (mechs) with this thing too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What is Aldnoah really?</strong> Is it some sort of stone, or some sort of energy? If it were just energy, they wouldn't have so advanced weapon systems, or not?</p>

<p>Where does the "Zero" in the name come from?</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">The physical nature of Aldnoah isn't touched on in the show or in any of the side materials I've read. To be clear, though, Aldnoah-the-power-source (what the royal family has direct control over) seems to be a distinct thing from Aldnoah-the-hyper-advanced-technology (the cataphracts, the Deucalion, the Landing Castles, etc.). It just so happens that the precursor Martian civilization had both of these things and used the former to power the latter.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; senshin on 2015-07-21 07:19:09</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">@senshin Well ok, this seems pretty right :D could you post it as an answer so I can accept it and this one is closed :D</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; JetStream on 2015-07-21 08:22:42</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">I've now found something out: 1. the producers of this anime worked together on "Fate/Zero  so this name was used in this anime too. and 2. The ".Zero" could reffer to the types of fighting of the protagonists which don't use Aldnoah (so "Zero"). But nevertheless they have a Aldnoah-powered airship and so I don't think that's the answer :D</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; JetStream on 2015-07-21 12:09:33</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">@JetStream I'm not going to post that as an answer; there's still a fair bit of stuff I haven't read (like Twin Gemini) that could answer the question.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; senshin on 2015-07-21 16:38:39</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">I merged your two questions as they are both asking about the meaning behind the title. In the future, try not to ask two questions about different parts of the same thing.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; кяαzєя on 2015-07-21 22:43:01</span></div>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="38734"></a><p>I believe Aldnoah refers to the power/energy itself. "Aldnoah.Zero" or "Aldnoah Zero" is never named or stated in-series. It could just be meant as a cool title, but I like to imagine it refers to the Terrans who fight without Aldnoah or other Versian weapons/technology. ;)</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="23538"></a><p>Aldnoah is the technology and power source the Martians use. The "Zero" part of the title is likely just there to make the title seem more appealing.</p>
