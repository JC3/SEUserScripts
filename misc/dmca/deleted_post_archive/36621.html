<div><span class="comment-text">In episode 10, Corteo comments that it's been 3 months since they returned to Lawless. 91 might well be the number of days between Avilio returning to Lawless in episode 1, and leaving again in episode 12.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; senshin on 2016-10-09 09:19:26</span></div>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="37742"></a><p>The 90 days signify the days left until the opening of the Opera House, which was mentioned in the wedding episode 2 by Frate, who tells them that Don Gallasia decided to attend the opening show. The 91 days refers to the time in which his revenge takes place since arriving.</p>
