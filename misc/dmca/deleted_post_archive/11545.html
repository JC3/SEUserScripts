<td class="post-cell"><a name="11595"></a><p>Ok, i am unsure what you mean by a 3rd Season but here's what i've looked up, there is</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6052" rel="nofollow">xxxHOLiC</a> (Season 1) which was saw a number of releases outside Japan, 24 Episodes</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=8551" rel="nofollow">xxxHOLiC: Kei</a> (Season 2), this hasn't see as many releases, in the link there is a French Translator and Arabic Broadcaster but no licencing or distribution companies are listed, 13 Episodes</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=10583" rel="nofollow">xxxHOLiC: Shunmuki</a> (OVA), so far only dench is listed, 2 Episodes</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=11396" rel="nofollow">xxxHOLiC: Rō</a> (OVA), only in japan, 1 Episode</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=12056" rel="nofollow">xxxHOLiC: Rō Adayume</a> (OAV), once again only in japan, 1 Episode</p></li>
</ul>

<p>there is also a xxxHOLiC movie called <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=4212" rel="nofollow">xxxHOLiC the Movie: A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>, numerous releases and from what i've seen in Australia gets released with <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=5148" rel="nofollow">Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE the Movie: The Princess in the Birdcage Kingdom</a> aswell.</p>

<p>Finally, i should forget the <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=2890" rel="nofollow">Manga</a> which is released in English.</p>

<p>the List above is i'm assuming the chronological order as the links all seem to indicate that much but i haven't seen the series myself however xxxHOLiC ties itself with Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE from my understanding.</p>

<p>To answer you main question <strong>How many seasons are there of xxxHolic</strong> i'd say only 2 Seasons and 4 OVA's (remember Shunmuki has 2 episodes)</p>

<p>Now i have no idea how long the OVA episodes go for however i accept Maria Watches Over Us OVA Season 3 is a season by itself as that has 4 episodes about 40-50 minutes each, in a sense that's about 8-10 regular episodes of a normal series or if xxxHOLiC's episodes OVA episodes are about that you can refer to them as seasons aswell</p>
