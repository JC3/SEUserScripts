<td class="post-cell"><a name="23553"></a><p>I remember someone saying (not sure which episode, though probably the same) that Eren lost his 3D-gear after existing his titan form. I also remember seeing that myself both after exiting titan form every time except the 2nd time (He had no gear on then to begin with). So how was the girl inside the female-titan able to have 3D-gear on as well as a survey-corp coat?</p>

<p>Note: I have finished watching the anime, but I have not read the manga. Please don't post any spoilers for me. Thank you :)</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">Erwin said,"`if they'd prepared maneuver gear in advance`" it is not necessary they were be holding gear in titan form, they could prepare somewhere or get from the dead army, we know female titan had planned it , so she might have prepared gear for those case.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; mirroroftruth on 2015-07-26 06:37:07</span></div>

<p>Whilst riding on horseback</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Zoe-</strong> Erwin, why did you order Levi to resupply? There's no time to
  waste.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Erwin-</strong> The female-form Titan was eaten. But did you see the person
  inside get eaten? I didn't.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Zoe-</strong> You can't mean-</p>
  
  <p><strong>Erwin-</strong> Ah, yes. <strong>If your original hypothesis was correct, they can
  still move to a degree after regaining human form.</strong> If they'd prepared
  3D Maneuver Gear in advance...</p>

  <p> <strong>Erwin-</strong> The person inside the female-form titan is wearing our uniform right now... The enemy is now camouflaged as one of the troops.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="23821"></a><p>As <a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/23553/in-episode-20-of-attack-on-titan-how-does-the-female-titan-have-3d-gear-after-re#comment33819_23553">mirroroftruth</a> has already kindly linked, it is speculated by Erwin that someone who is talented with their titan ability may be able to regain their human form with minimal exhaustion. This means that, with appropriate planning or fortuitous circumstances at transformation, the controller (pilot?) could quickly change clothes or equipment using the transformation itself as cover. This is possibly shown by the Colossal Titan in earlier episodes:<br>

<p>or by the female titan herself during the carnage of her body being eaten. So she may not come out of the titan already wearing the 3D-gear, but instead may have picked up a nearby set.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="23555"></a><p>I think it was also stated somewhere that after shifting a few times, it is possible to control damage done to your clothing. That being said, the Female Titan has had to shift a few times, so she could take precautions when doing so.</p>
