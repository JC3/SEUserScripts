<td class="post-cell"><a name="18840"></a><p>I just watched season 1 (episodes 1-22) of Psycho Pass on Netflix and now I want to watch the rest.</p>

<p>On the Funimation site there is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Episodes 1-22 (Season 1)</li>
<li>Specials 1-11</li>
<li>Episodes 23-33 (Season 2)</li>
<li>Also there is the recently released movie.</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't started any of the specials or season 2 yet; I don't want to accidentally watch something out of order and spoil it. My question is: Where do the specials fit into the series? Between the two seasons? Side stories? Prequel? After season 2? When should I watch them?</p>

<p>The episode lists I've found seem to leave out the specials so I'm not sure how they fit in.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="18842"></a><p>If you've watched the first season, you should skip the specials and proceed directly to the second season. After that, watch the movie (when it's available).</p>

<p>The "specials" (usually called "Psycho Pass: New Edit" or "Psycho Pass: Extended Edition", I think) are a re-cut/updated version of season 1, <a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/14021/1908">with only minor changes</a>. The reason there are only 11 of them is that they're double-length. If you were starting from nothing, it would have been better to watch the "specials" and then season 2, but since you've already seen season 1, I don't think there's enough new content to warrant watching the re-cut version before moving on to season 2.</p>

<p>That said, if you ever find yourself wanting to rewatch the first season of Psycho Pass, I would recommend watching the "specials" instead of the original version of season 1.</p>
