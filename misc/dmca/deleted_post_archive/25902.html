<td class="post-cell"><a name="25902"></a><p><em>Death Note</em> and <em>Death Parade</em> are both from the anime studio MADHOUSE. The anime are definitely different, but in episode 11 of <em>Death Parade</em>, there was a person shown, who reminded me of Light Yagami.</p>

<p><em>Death Parade</em> is an anime that's about a place after death, where you are either sent to nowhere (hell) or you are going to be reincarnated (heaven). So I was wondering if there was a deeper meaning in showing this person, because after Light's death, it isn't impossible that he is going to be judged in this world.</p>

<p>I am very grateful for some clear answer.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="25921"></a><p>The only way to know for sure is to contact MADHOUSE. Though it's likely that this look-alike is the product of the recycling of character styles.</p>

<p>The Death Note states that those who use it won't go to heaven or hell. This means that in the Death Note universe, there is heaven and hell. Strictly speaking, the idea of heaven and hell don't get along with the idea of reincarnation.</p>

<p>Technically, it isn't <em>100%</em> impossible that the shinigami got it wrong. Perhaps they could've seen the doors, but not received an explanation, and they drew a wrong conclusion?</p>

<p>Summarily, it's unlikely that Light Yagami would be in this universe, but it's... <em>possible</em>.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="33639"></a><p>When the concept of heaven and hell is explained in <em>Death Parade</em>, it is mentioned that it is only explained that way because its easier for people to understand.  So while <em>Death Note</em>, does say that, I wouldn't take it at face value.  There might be some correlation between the Shinigami and the arbiters.</p>
