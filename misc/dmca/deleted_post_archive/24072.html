<div><span class="comment-text">ZHIEND doesn't exist in real life. They're a fictional creation for the world of Charlotte. You can see at http://charlotte-anime.jp/music/zhiend/ that they're described as a 劇中バンド, meaning "band-within-the-show".</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; senshin on 2015-08-14 16:04:22</span></div>
