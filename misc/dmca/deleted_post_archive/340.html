<tr class="question"><td class="score-cell" rowspan="3">17
<td class="post-cell"><a name="340"></a><p>At the end of each Cowboy Bebop, there is a phrase (or a title card, as the <a href="http://cowboybebop.wikia.com/wiki/Memorable_Quotes_from_Cowboy_Bebop#Ending_Title_Cards_in_Order_of_Episodes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Cowboy Bebop Wiki</a> calls them). In most of the sessions, the phrase reads <strong>"See You space cowboy..."</strong>.<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aUrI8iI.jpg" width="250" height="188"><br>
However, there are some variations:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Session 3: <strong>"Easy Come, Easy Go..."</strong> - It is (most likely) a reference to how easy it is to win and lose money in a casino, since this episode takes place in one.  </li>
<li>Session 11: <strong>"The End"</strong> - I actually don't know if this is a reference, or simply a classic <em>'The End'</em>.</li>
<li>Session 12: <strong>"To Be Continued "</strong> - It simply states the fact that this episode is a <em>Part 1</em>, and the story is to be continued in the next session.  </li>
<li><p>Session 13: <strong>"Do You Have a comrade? "</strong> - It is a reference to:  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> the relationship that Gren had with Vicious, and the fact that Spike helps him in the end.  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Session 15: <strong>"Sleeping Beast"</strong> - It is a reference to <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>, since:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Faye was 'asleep' too (preserved in a cryogenic state). But I am not sure about the <em>Beast</em> part.  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Session 17: <strong>"Life is but a dream..."</strong> - Is a reference to the events that take place during the episode, namely</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> their hallucinations.  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Session 22: <strong>"See You Space Samurai... "</strong> - It is a reference to</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Andy's transformation (from cowboy to samurai) in the end of the episode.  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Session 23: <strong><em>None</em></strong> - Don't know if this even needs to <em>have</em> a reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Session 24: <strong>"See You Cowgirl, Someday, Somewhere!"</strong> - It is a reference to</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Ed (and Ein) parting from the rest of the crew.  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Session 25: <strong>"To Be Continued "</strong> - Again, simply a reference to the fact that this episode is a <em>Part 1</em>, and the story is to be continued in the next session.  </p></li>
<li>Session 26: <strong>"You're gonna carry that weight."</strong> - <strong>???</strong><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tBMRE9g.jpg" width="250" height="188"></li>
</ul>

<p>So, what is the meaning of such a phrase, at the end of the last session? Does the author have some message that he wants to pass with this phrase? Or is it simply a reference to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_That_Weight" rel="nofollow noreferrer">eponymous Beatles' song</a>? </p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="362"></a><p>Seeing as you see a image of Spike before this final line is displayed, I think there's little doubt that this quote is entirely directed at Spike. What meaning it holds for Spike, might be open to debate, but here's one take on it:</p>

<p>It makes sense to me that the quote references the weight that Spike carried around with him after leaving the syndicate. Throughout the series, Spike seems like a pretty easy-going guy ("whatever happens, happens"), except for when the life he left behind catches up with him.</p>

<p>Whenever something or someone from his past crosses his life, you'll notice that he starts acting differently (i.e. how he reacts when he hears Julia's name at the beginning of "Jupiter Jazz"). I think it's implied that he's been carrying a lot of emotional baggage around from his earlier days, since he always talks about not knowing whether he is really alive or dead.</p>

<p>Although it can be said that he's referring to his his near-death experience, I think he's also referring to the fact that he hasn't really felt alive since he left the syndicate. </p>

<p>The "weight" described might be all the inner turmoil he's carried and never had a chance to deal with dealt with throughout the run of the show. Perhaps this quote is a reflection on the quintessential parts of Spike was never explorer over the course of the entire series?</p>

<p>Also I can't help but think that the title and lyrics of the Beetle's song "Carry That Weight" carries a deeper meaning that parallels the show. If you're a fan of the band you've probably heard about these two interpretations. According to the <a href="http://beatles.wikia.com/wiki/Carry_That_Weight">Beatles Wiki</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One interpretation is that the title (and main lyric) is a reference to two people, John Lennon and Paul McCartney. In McCartney's view, if Lennon allowed the Beatles to break up, he would be "carrying the weight" for that for the rest of his life. McCartney essentially blames Lennon and Yoko Ono for the decline in the band's relationship. The second reference, to McCartney himself, is about "carrying the weight" of the band by acting as the manager after the death of Brian Epstein. Until he took on the job, McCartney had never realized how much Epstein did for them, nor how difficult it was to manage the financial side of the Beatles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Supposedly, after the song's interlude, "Paul, you're going to carry that weight" can be heard in the chorus.</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> In this sense you could could see Spike as John Lennon, and his decision to go to the syndicate as Lennon's decision to allow The Beatles to break up. Even though Ed and Ein (which combined, is some respects, represents Ringo) had already left at that point, the Bebop still had its three main characters together and could have continued living together without things changing (just missing a drummer). As Spike is leaving, Faye (in McCartney's role) vainly tries to threaten/persuade Spike into staying. She knows his departure will mean the end of the Bebop as they know it, implying that Spike deciding to leave would make him responsible for the dissolution. Then both of them die before they can reunite with their (respective) group, at the hands of their so-called "friends" (Vicious, as a former ally of Spike, and Chapman, as a schizophrenic fan). Therefore, Spike, because he chose to leave the ship and face certain death, and bear the "blame" for the ending of the name of the Bebop (to the characters of the show), while also providing the literal ending to the series.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="352"></a><p>It can mean a lot of things really, depending on your point of view on</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> whether Spike dies in the end, or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even if you put that away for a minute, a lot of things happen in the last episode. </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Julia dies on Spike's hands. Shin dies too, hinting that if Vicious is killed, Spike wil become the new leader of Syndicate (and if you think Spike survived, you might think that this <em>is</em> the weight he's gonna carry). Finally, he kills Vicious. If you think about it, Spike has finished his business regarding the syndicate and Vicious. But while doing it he also loses Julia. It is also the weight he's going to carry, even if he dies in the end: he knows that Julia died. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yes, of course it's also a reference to a rock classics - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_That_Weight">Carry that weight</a> by The Beetles.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>A little off-topic:</strong>
I personally thing that this moment of "incompleteness" is what makes animes like this great: everyone may find the explanation that suits him better. So this intentionally open ending allows you to chose the one explanation that is most suitable for you ;)</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="5930"></a><p>I agree with Krazer but I feel more like the phrase is directed towards us, the viewers. We saw the crew of the Bebop desperately try to escape their past lives and we got to know them. We cheered Spike, Jet and Faye on throughout the series until Spike essentially brought everything to a close by choosing to see if he was 'truly alive'. From here we're left with the idea that Jet and Faye will likely move on and everything has come full circle (Jet was still a bounty hunter for some time before meeting Spike, Faye drifted from planet to planet trying to come to terms with her mysterious past, Ed may have found her father again or maybe she's back to what she did before meeting the Bebop crew.)</p>

<p>"You're gonna carry that weight" is a reference to the fact that we're the ones who'll be carrying the emotional "weight" (Spike's death, and the end of the Bebop's adventures) of the ending, thats what we'll take away from it.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="8787"></a><p>I agree with gegegege.  It almost felt like a joke at first; being all upset about Spike dying just for the show to remind you, "You're gonna carry that weight," kicking off a period of depression.  The interesting thing about Cowboy Bebop was that it always addressed you at the end ("See you, Space Cowboy").  That was the part when you (may have) turned off the television, stopped being a observer, and become a participant in reality. "Carry That Weight" is about the past, and by coming to the end of Cowboy Bebop, by sticking with the characters, the show has become a part of your past.  For most fans, an important part of the past. A show, a completely made-up story, has caused you emotional triumph and burden.  It's the glory of fiction, really, that it can shape who we are almost as much as life experiences.  Where there's usually a detachment from anime, you're reminded that you're going to face such emotions as Spike, Fay, and Jet had by real-life situations.  You're likely going to have a 23-episode period of happiness, before the last three episodes see the dissolution of old friendships or a visit from the past. Things can never be the same again, such as in the Beatles song Carry That Weight: "Once there was a way to get back homeward."  You carry the emotional burden of what was and what could have been.</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">Golden Slumbers and Carry That Weight are both somewhat tied together into one song, since they are part of the [medley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Road#Medley) from Abbey Road.

<td class="post-cell"><a name="8645"></a><p>When Spike killed Vicious he became leader of the Red Dragons. Despite his will he must accept that, since there is no exit from that organisation.</p>

<p>Or it may point that Spike is the last survivor of triangle between Julia Vicious and him. 
Also all people from his past are dead, and as only survivor he would bear the weight of past events.</p>
