<td class="post-cell"><a name="27154"></a><p>I know there are currently over 700 One Piece episodes with subtitles, lots of people like the subtitles, I strongly prefer the English dubbed version. The English dub currently ends at 421 sadly.</p>

<p>How can I find out when new English dubbed episodes will be released?</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="27157"></a><p>You can keep a track of the dubbed episode DVD releases on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_episodes#Season_13_.282009.E2.80.932010.29" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> where you can see that the dubbed versions of Episode 422-433 will be released on December 15, 2015 and the dubbed versions of episode 434-445 will be released on January 26, 2016.</p>

<p><strong>The dubbed version is released online 2 weeks before the DVD Sales go out.</strong> You can find them uploaded on <a href="http://www.funimation.com/shows/one-piece/videos/episodes" rel="nofollow">Funimation site</a> or other sites.</p>

<p>You may also keep track of the DVD release dates on <a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/FUNimation_Entertainment/Episode_List_and_DVD_Releases" rel="nofollow">One Piece Wiki</a> where too, you shall find the same information.</p>

<p>A final alternative is <a href="http://www.english-dubbed.com/knowledge-bazaar/releases/" rel="nofollow">this</a> site which is not only for tracking the release of the dubbed episodes of One Piece but also other anime.</p>
