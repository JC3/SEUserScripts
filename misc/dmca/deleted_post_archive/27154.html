<td class="post-cell"><a name="27154"></a><p>I know there are currently over 700 One Piece episodes with subtitles, lots of people like the subtitles, I strongly prefer the English dubbed version. The English dub currently ends at 421 sadly.</p>

<p>How can I find out when new English dubbed episodes will be released?</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">By the way guys, if you're viewing this you might find it interesting that, looking back on this question asked three months ago, I've already watched all of the remaining episodes in subtitled form, and ***it will no longer bother you after watching 100 subtitled episodes.*** This is partly because I enjoyed the story so much.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Viziionary on 2016-02-10 17:44:31</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">Very true. Subtitled is kind of hard to get used to, but its well worth it since almost if not all anime is Subbed long before its dubbed, many of the more obscure but very good ones are never dubbed, and though it takes a while, once you get used to it, the impact to the experience is minimal.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Ryan on 2016-08-05 16:05:24</span></div>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="27157"></a><p>You can keep a track of the dubbed episode DVD releases on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_episodes#Season_13_.282009.E2.80.932010.29" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> where you can see that the dubbed versions of Episode 422-433 will be released on December 15, 2015 and the dubbed versions of episode 434-445 will be released on January 26, 2016.</p>

<p><strong>The dubbed version is released online 2 weeks before the DVD Sales go out.</strong> You can find them uploaded on <a href="http://www.funimation.com/shows/one-piece/videos/episodes" rel="nofollow">Funimation site</a> or other sites.</p>

<p>You may also keep track of the DVD release dates on <a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/FUNimation_Entertainment/Episode_List_and_DVD_Releases" rel="nofollow">One Piece Wiki</a> where too, you shall find the same information.</p>

<p>A final alternative is <a href="http://www.english-dubbed.com/knowledge-bazaar/releases/" rel="nofollow">this</a> site which is not only for tracking the release of the dubbed episodes of One Piece but also other anime.</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">Those dates aren't accurate.
I've watched the English version dubbed of Episodes 422-433 already on watchcartoononline but that's where it stops.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; user19531 on 2015-12-05 21:41:10</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">Thanks for pointing it out. I edited my post. I was talking about the DVD Release dates. If you're looking for the online releases, you can look for them a couple of weeks before the DVD Release.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Ashishgup on 2015-12-05 22:01:05</span></div>
