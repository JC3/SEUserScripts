<div><span class="comment-text">Dear close voters: notice that the second line of this question says "legally". That means this question is not requesting illegal copyrighted materials. If there is nowhere to watch or download legally, the answer is that there is nowhere to watch or download legally, but that does not make the question off-topic.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Torisuda on 2017-03-26 20:23:34</span></div>

<div><span class="comment-text">You were fine. You said "legally" in your question, per our guidelines. But someone has initiated a close vote against your question for violating our guidelines about asking for illegal material like fansubs and torrents, which is clearly wrong because you did say "legally". I left my comment for anyone else who came along so they would notice that and vote against closing your question.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Torisuda on 2017-03-26 20:39:27</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">okay i'll remember next time thank you for helping me.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; H101 on 2017-03-26 20:43:32</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">i doubt you'll be able to download it. also the "release" date is when it was played in cinemas like how with a series the initial release date is when it first aired. generally when it comes to movies this initial release date much much earlier than the home release (where the anime is released on DVD)</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Memor-X on 2017-03-26 21:28:21</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">that means i need to wait until that..</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; H101 on 2017-03-26 21:31:20</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">Depending on where you live, you might be able to catch it in a movie theater. In my area it's playing in a few cinemas, but I live near a pretty major city.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Torisuda on 2017-03-26 21:42:25</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">well in our state thats not working so i need to wait untill its upload on web.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; H101 on 2017-03-26 21:44:40</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">@Torisuda Sorry about the close vote--something screwed up on mobile and I couldn't figure out how to fix it.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; kuwaly on 2017-03-27 04:20:08</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">@kuwaly Ah, no worries. I've screwed up on mobile too.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Torisuda on 2017-03-27 05:36:57</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">I'd imagine that crunchyroll,netflix,hulu and youtube would get it eventually. But at the point of release if it's not at a theater near you then the only legal way would be to play the waiting game.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; kaz on 2017-03-27 21:56:13</span></div>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="39618"></a><p>You can't, the only place you can see it at the moment is in a theatre, as it hasn't been released on disc yet. Once it releases on disc, you can then either buy it from a shop or use a legal streaming service like Netflix if it gets released there. TV channel also play anime sometimes, so you might be able to find it there too soon.</p>
