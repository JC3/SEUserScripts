<td class="post-cell"><a name="7905"></a><p>I have seen the photos at the end of the Non Non Biyori episodes and they seem to resemble places from within the anime. I wonder if all those photographed places belong to roughly the same location.</p>

<p>In other words: <strong>Is the Asahigaoka village in Non Non Biyori based on a real one?</strong></p>

<p>And if yes: <strong>Where is this located?</strong></p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="7907"></a><p>The town of Asahigaoka is not explicitly based on any single real location. Of course, some location scouting in the countryside was performed for the sake of realism.<sup>1</sup> Most anime these days engage in this activity (called "location hunting" / ロケハン) when appropriate - e.g. when they are set in modern Japan or something that looks like it.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>That said, the school the students in Non Non Biyori attend <em>is</em> apparently based on a real school: Ogawa Elementary's Shimosato Branch School<sup>3</sup> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogawa,_Saitama" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ogawa, Saitama</a>.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Of course, some shows <em>do</em> use full-on model cities, e.g. <a href="http://otakumode.com/sp/visit_japan/seichi-junrei/s005" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ano Hana</a> and <a href="http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=497109" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ano Natsu de Matteru</a>. </p>

<p><sup>3</sup> I believe I translated that well enough, but school nomenclature confuses me at times - the name in Japanese is 小川町立小川小学校 下里分校, lit. "Ogawa-machi Municipal Ogawa Elementary School, Shimosato Branch School". </p>
