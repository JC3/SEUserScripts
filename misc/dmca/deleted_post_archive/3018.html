<td class="post-cell"><a name="3018"></a><p>I want to watch Bleach, but the anime has a lot of filler content not in the manga. I'd rather not watch the filler content and only watch the episodes which are directly related to the plot. To be clear, I'm defining a filler episode as one which is not based on any story in the manga or based on extra manga chapters which have nothing to do with the overarching story.</p>

<p>Which episodes are filler?</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">Thank you very much for great list. For those who'd like to know, that means that until episode 366, there are **201** non-filler episodes to watch. Ps. I found this useful plus I cannot comment :( so separate answer, sorry</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; user4117 on 2014-03-14 06:13:48</span></div>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="3019"></a><p>The following episodes are anime-original content which you should skip if you aren't interested in filler. Some of the other episodes include original elements or reference events from filler episodes, but these do not impact the story in the long run so you can safely ignore them. The ones based on manga omake are noted as such.</p>

<p>Compactly, the fillers are: <strong>33, 50, 64-109, 128-137, 147-149, 168-189, 204-205, 213-214, 227-266, 287, 298-299, 303-305, 311-342, 355</strong>. In more detail:</p>

<p>The series ends with episode 366, at which point you can pick up from manga chapter 480 if you so choose.</p>

<p>The sources for this are scattered across a number of sites, but of particular note are <a href="http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Bleach_Wiki">Bleach Wiki</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bleach_episodes#Episode_list">Wikipedia's list of Bleach episodes</a>, and <a href="http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=266473">this MAL forum post</a>. However, all had at least some errors so I've had to check on various other websites as well.</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">lol, it's all good.  I was just sitting there at my computer watching episode 205 and thinking, "This is totally a filler, and how in the heck did Ichigo get back to the real world, I'm pretty that the Gargatan thing was closed!?
