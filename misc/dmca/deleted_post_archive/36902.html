<td class="post-cell"><a name="36902"></a><p>The background music at 13:37 of episode 7 in Psycho-Pass season 1 is incredible but I am not able to identify it. I already tried music recognition apps like Shazam. They were not able to recognize it. It could be a modified or original version of Beethoven's 9th symphony. Can someone confirm?</p>
