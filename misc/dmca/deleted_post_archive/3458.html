<p>What is the significance of this cat that appears in just about every episode of the Trigun anime and makes appearances in the manga? What gender is this cat?</p>

<p>Is it an inside joke? Where/how did it originate?</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="3467"></a><p>It was (one of) the first character(s) created by Yasuhiro Nightow and it became 
sort of a signature mark. The name of the cat is Kuroneko-sama (ie. Lord Black Cat) and The <a href="http://trigun.wikia.com/wiki/Kuroneko">Trigun wiki</a> states the cat is a "she". From the link:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nightow has stated that she is just something easy and calming to draw in between action scenes.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="25847"></a><p>Actually the black cat is believed by a lot of people to be as a memorial. What i mean by that is the person who created Trigun put a black cat in the episode in memory of a cat that was loved very much. Most people love the animals they have very much and what better way to keep the memory alive by putting a drawing of it in your show? I personally think that this makes the most sense.</p>
