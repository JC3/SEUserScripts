<td class="post-cell"><a name="3262"></a><p>In the first half of the first episode of Hataraku Maou-sama, we can hear conversation between Satan and Alsiel in "Underworld" language. Is the "Underworld" language based on a real language, or is it just plain gibberish?</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="3692"></a><p>According to <a href="http://purisoku.com/archives/6496740.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> (which cites from a 2ch thread), the language is is pretty simple: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Entean language is basically letter substituted English, with vowel keeping their original position, while the consonants are reversed, so B=Z, C=Y, D=X, ... and vice versa. </p>

<pre><code>   ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
-&gt; AZYXEWVTISRLPNOMQKJHUGFDCB
</code></pre>
  
  <p>For example:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>人間 human → tupan</li>
  <li>世界 world → foklx</li>
  <li>魔王（芦屋による呼称） majesty → pasejhc</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>They say it with such enthusiasm, too:</p>

<p>It seems that it <strong><em>IS</em></strong> gibberish. They just jumbled a lot of languages together  (English, French and German to name a few). </p>

<p>Here are some quotes from the thread <em>(I am still not sure if they can be counted on as being 'facts'):</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The way they threw random words of other actual languages into their made up language was
  very funny, especially if you understand Japanese (how foreign words are 
  transliterated/pronounced in a syllabary language). - Usuzumiiro <a href="http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=580793#WAHLukAMEgLREzwl.99" rel="nofollow">(1)</a></p>
  
  <p>I kept trying to figure out what language they were speaking only to learn it was made up <a href="http://www.rabuko.me/maouspeak/" rel="nofollow">maouspeak</a>... sneaky anime. - AOMINE <a href="http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=580793&amp;show=20#57cRtit5kYgQbCec.99" rel="nofollow">(2)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tracked these down by just going to page 1 of that thread then searching for the word "language". It seems the general consensus is it is gibberish and that it is a mixture of words. Still looking for the actual source for them all to say that though. <em>(I am thinking it is on 4chan)</em></p>
