<td class="post-cell"><a name="34542"></a><p>Is there any official source stating how many episodes Dragon Ball Super will have? With all the open stories it has (Bills, Champa, the multi universe tournament, Zeno-sama, Zamasu, Black Goku, etc) I can't image them all fitting in the once rumored 100 episodes.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="36317"></a><p>Until now, it is officially confirmed to have <strong><em>at least</em></strong> <a href="http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2016/05/23/dragon-ball-super-dvd-blu-ray-boxes-4-6-announced/" rel="nofollow">72 episodes</a> of DBS. <a href="http://attackofthefanboy.com/news/rumor-dragon-ball-super-go-long-100-episodes/" rel="nofollow">Rumors</a> have shown that it will be 100 episodes, or even more if it's getting more popularity, but all of that is <strong><em>not true</em></strong>. Rumors are rumors, it is not yet confirmed, all we can do is to wait for upcoming news.</p>
