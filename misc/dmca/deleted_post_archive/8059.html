<td class="post-cell"><a name="8059"></a><p>In the intro of SKET Dance, One of the scenes is in an empty swimming pool with the word SKAT.</p>

<p>The show is definitely called "SKET" Dance. and stands for Support, Kindness, Encouragement &amp; Troubleshoot.</p>

<p>Is this a really bad typo, or was it intention and I'm missing the point entirely?</p>

<p>In this screenshot the 'A' is in pink too, drawing attention to it.</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">@Dimitrimx Seems unlikely. _kintama_ means "balls" in Japanese (so that pun works), but "scat"/"skat" doesn't mean anything in Japanese, so that probably isn't it.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; senshin on 2014-06-04 17:07:58</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">[Related chiebukuro post](http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1162313481) - the gist is that this "SKAT" is accompanied by the word "DENCE" somewhere, and that this is somehow related? Haven't seen the show, though, so I don't know if this makes sense.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; senshin on 2014-06-04 17:09:16</span></div>

<div><span class="comment-text">If I remember correctly Sket dance, just like gintama makes use of a word joke. Skat meaning something along the lines of poo. Where gintama often gets called kintama aswell which was i believe balls?</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Dimitri mx on 2014-03-19 22:45:10</span></div>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="18376"></a><p>See the cat sign beside Sket dance sign.. That's why.. It was used as a pun.. Also the 'Dance'
The original was 'SKET Dans'. But 'Dans' and 'Dance' sound similiar. That's why. It's a pun.. just for fun.. So it wasn't a mistake.. I chose it.</p>
