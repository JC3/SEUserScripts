<td class="post-cell"><a name="8059"></a><p>In the intro of SKET Dance, One of the scenes is in an empty swimming pool with the word SKAT.</p>

<p>The show is definitely called "SKET" Dance. and stands for Support, Kindness, Encouragement &amp; Troubleshoot.</p>

<p>Is this a really bad typo, or was it intention and I'm missing the point entirely?</p>

<p>In this screenshot the 'A' is in pink too, drawing attention to it.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="18376"></a><p>See the cat sign beside Sket dance sign.. That's why.. It was used as a pun.. Also the 'Dance'
The original was 'SKET Dans'. But 'Dans' and 'Dance' sound similiar. That's why. It's a pun.. just for fun.. So it wasn't a mistake.. I chose it.</p>
