<p>edit: The time is around 14:30
edit: It's used as background music in most of the comedic parties that the characters have in One Piece.</p>

<p>After some additional searching I found that the piano solo is part of the song called <strong>Village Harbour</strong> (or Minato Mura in Japanese), which is supposed to be part of the second song of the second OST collection as shown on <a href="http://youtu.be/QZA5qCfRZQc?t=1m17s">Youtube</a></p>
