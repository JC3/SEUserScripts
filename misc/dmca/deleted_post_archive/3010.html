<td class="post-cell"><a name="3010"></a><p>I've read that <em>Dragon Ball Z Kai</em> is an HD remaster and recut of <em>Dragon Ball</em> and <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>. However, <em>Kai</em> has <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Dragon_Ball_Z_Kai_episodes">98 episodes</a> while <em>Dragon Ball</em> has <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Dragon_Ball_episodes">153</a> and <em>Z</em> has <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Dragon_Ball_Z_episodes">almost 300</a>.</p>

<p>If I watch only <em>Dragon Ball Z Kai</em>, do I miss anything I would get by watching the other two series? And is anything censored in <em>Kai</em> that is not censored in the others?</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">Most minor arcs and fillers and physical contact in fights are missing. DBZ Kai also ends after the cell sage (skips 6 volumes, which are the best) and starts after Dragon Ball (the first 16). DBZ Kai is comparable to  any anime that has been ruined by 4Kids (the 4Kids version of DBZ Kai is a bad relatively. In conclusion, watch the real DBZ 'cause it is good and a classic and you get to see Kid Trunks in action.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; TAAPSogeking on 2013-10-06 00:19:05</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">This might not seem as much of an answer as a complaint. I've watched only a few episodes which dosen't give me much to work with. But what I think I have the right to complain about is the fact that these are just normal episodes off the original Z series give or take a few scenes and improved intros the least they can do is make the whole episode improved. Also the episodes titles seem too long. I'm not saying that I hate it (I actually love the theme song called 'Dragon Soul' [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Goqzyg6kfiw)) RECOMMENDED!!

<td class="post-cell"><a name="3015"></a><p>First off, <em>Dragon Ball Z Kai</em> doesn't include anything from <em>Dragon Ball</em>, which is the story of Goku as a child. Secondly, the main difference is that <em>Kai</em> lacks the filler content of the original <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, and stops at the end of the Cell saga. </p>

<p>By filler I mean content not originally in the manga. Some (like myself enjoyed the filler), while others though it to be extra fluff. <em>Kai</em> is more faithful to the manga, than the original anime was. In some cases though, this could affect how some see the development of characters. For example: In the original <em>DBZ</em>, one of the most intriguing, and perhaps touching moments is Gohan surviving in alone in the wilderness. The challenges &amp; events he faces, as well as the people he meet all influence the person he becomes later on. Much of this was cut in Kai, and so unless you've already seen <em>DBZ</em> it might seem a little choppy.</p>

<p>By ending at the Cell saga, it ends in the place where the original author Akira Toriyama wanted it to. In doing so, you miss the about two-three seasons that came afterward.</p>

<p>The are also other small differences between the two: including different music in some cases, and new scenes added/redone in <em>Kai</em>.</p>

<p>As for censorship, some scenes where updated to fit the new standards of Japanese Television. In American productions of the anime (namely dubs), there could have been further censoring. I can't remember the name of the company at the moment, but one when so far as to make the character Mr. Popo blue, as to lessen claims of racism.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yVlIn.jpg" alt="Scene edited to remove blood"> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VBWu9.png" alt="Mr. Popo&#39;s skin is normally pitch black."></p>

<p>Given the facts, you can make up your mind as to which you will watch, but in my humble opinion I would go with the originals first, and later on, if you want, you can look into <em>Kai</em> as an abridgment. As someone who has personally watch both, I must say that I only enjoyed <em>Kai</em> because I was able to fill in the details myself. If I had never seen <em>DBZ</em> I doubt I would have felt this comfortable.</p>

<p>I hope I helped! :) </p>

<div><span class="comment-text">Not sure if this needs to be updated, since at this point DBZ Kai doesn't end at the Cell saga. Since april this year they have started airing the Majin Buu saga too.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Peter Raeves on 2014-06-26 11:43:54</span></div>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="5974"></a><p>Kai is not too bad as I'm currently watching it on KIX. BUT! there are silly things chopped away from what I remember in Dragonball Z. </p>

<p>(SPOILER ALERT) </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Cell stomps and crushes Android 16's head after he's done telling
 Gohan to embrace his inner anger to defeat Cell. In Dragonball Kai,
 this is cut out and only Android 16's brain cartridge and a few bolts
 are seen MAGICALLY on the scene. Yet During the Frieza saga you get to
 see Krillin use 'Destructo Disc' to cut off Frieza's tail which did
 happen in both Z and Kai but this clashes with the head crushing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me Dragonball Z DESTROYS Kai in every form and shape because its more influential in all the characters development. Not to mention I've yet to see Yamcha use his technique The Wolf Fang Fist.</p>

<p>From what I've read as well we are going to lose out on the Majin Buu Saga, the Kid Buu Saga and the Super Android 17 Saga.</p>

<p>Lastly it hasn't been mentioned from what I've read but even though it's only a filler what happened to the Garlic Jr saga? If I remember correctly it was based after the return from Namek. I could be wrong. So much is cut from Z, it's sort of depressing.</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">Super 17 Saga is not DBZ, but its bastard son: Dragonball GT. Garlic Jr. saga doesn't appears on comics, and it's based on a plot that comes from an OVA which was plot-incompatible with the series, so it's possibly the best part to cut.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Flamma on 2013-12-29 17:35:49</span></div>
