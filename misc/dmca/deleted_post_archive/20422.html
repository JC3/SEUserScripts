  <p> So it looks like he faces Arima the reaper for a fight? He sets down Hide's body and looks to get ready to face off against Arima. It looks like they did start fighting. Then later we see Arima standing by himself with his weapon stuck in the snow:<br>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Did Arima defeat Kaneki or did the fight end in a draw? This was obviously left ambiguous, but are there other sources that explains what happens to Kaneki?</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="20423"></a><p>Yes, there are other sources.</p>

<p>The manga has a different, more revealing ending compared to the anime which just concluded. The ending in the manga also fuses more completely with the sequel, <em>Tokyo Ghoul:re</em>, which began serialization late 2014. The best thing to do would be to go back and read the last portion of the manga to get a different, more conclusive ending.</p>

<h3>Pertaining to Tokyo Ghoul:re</h3>

<p>Basically, as far as the manga is concerned, Kaneki:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> ... is now an amnesiac of sorts and is now known as Haise Sasaki, a Rank 1 investigator and the leader of a special unit of investigators at the Commission of Counter Ghoul(CCG). All the members of that unit underwent similar surgeries as him, allowing them to obtain the special abilities of ghouls in order to fight them, but still being able to live as normal humans.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> It seems that a lot of people want to simply write this off as speculation, with no proof that Haise Sasaki is indeed Ken Kaneki's new identity in the sequel who survived the conclusive battle with Arima and is now serving as a mentor at CCG under Akira Mado 2 years later.<br>
<br>
 Below are some brief hints from chapter 8 volume 1 (which has Sasaki on the cover) of <em>Tokyo Ghoul:re</em> without revealing too much. I find these to be a bit more than mere 'speculation'.<br>
<br>
 <em>Haise Sasaki begins to notice past self:</em><br>
<br>

<br>
 <em>Note the mention of a 2 year time span and an amnesia like state questioning about a past life of friends and family, as well as paternalistic Arima:</em><br>
<br>

</blockquote>

<p>In summary, to answer your question,</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> ... they did fight, and Kaneki did lose. While he did not die, the aftermath of the fight resulted in him having an amnesia and developing a new identity in a new exciting plot for the sequel, <strong>Tokyo Ghoul:re</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's impossible to tell what they would do in the animated adaptation until its release, although I'm sure it will follow along the same line of plot.</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">It's worth noting that the contents of the second spoiler are somewhat speculation, as this has not been confirmed. Also notable is the fact that the full battle was shown in the manga, including the death of the loser.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Killua on 2015-03-29 16:44:19</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">yeah^, i was just trying to keep it vague so if they wanted to they could go back and read it with out having to many 'hints' as to what might happen :D. either way enjoy !  @キルア thanks for hidden spoiler edit.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; shaggy on 2015-03-29 16:45:50</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">@キルア as far as it not being confirmed, the manga is out and you can see this to be true. At least to some extent. If something changes, or is later revealed upon farther reading, i will come back here and  edit it accordingly. :D</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; shaggy on 2015-03-29 17:31:24</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">The manga shows the character of Haise, but the connection to Kaneki you've talked about is speculation, as far as I know.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Killua on 2015-03-29 17:32:35</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">Point taken. I haven't read far enough to say, but either way i figure i'll leave it as speculation as of now, i just say they looks 'similar' haha :P
i liked your answer more anyways.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; shaggy on 2015-03-29 17:58:50</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">...and Kaneki obviously has some outstanding regeneration properties as displayed by 'Jason' torture antics. I don't see why this situation would be any different. That and the previously shown capabilities of doctors in the series. However, ill just account it as being hopeful for now :D</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; shaggy on 2015-03-29 18:20:02</span></div>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="20424"></a><p>Without looking at material which hasn't been released, since <em>Tokyo Ghoul:re</em> may be animated differently than its manga (considering the path √A took), we can conclude a bit about Kaneki's fate at the end of the series.<sup>†</sup></p>

<p><strong>Warning: The following is not only a spoiler from the manga, but also considerably graphic and perhaps not suitable for everyone.</strong></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> In the <em>Tokyo Ghoul</em> manga, which tells the events somewhat differently and places less focus on Kaneki, Kaneki and Arima had a brutal fight. Kaneki ended up losing, and Arima used brutal methods including eye gouging to defeat him. <strong>It is implied at this point that Kaneki is dead.</strong>
 <br/> <br/>
 It remains speculation to say whether or not Kaneki actually survived and continued his story in <em>Tokyo Ghoul:re</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This led to the following graphic scene:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jz5yN.png" alt="The final panel of the chapter"><br>
 The final panel of the chapter in the manga.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was not shown in the anime, but rather symbolized by Arima's weapon standing that way in the snow.</p>

<p><sub>† Since the anime had a slightly different take on things, it's impossible to say whether or not these details can be considered absolute truth, or simply informed speculation.</sub></p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="21458"></a><p>Kaneki will not die apparently, what happens is that he loses his memories. Kaneki will be come first class special investigator in Tokyo ghoul:re. Kaneki will be also haise sasaki. He does not die but he is in a group of half ghouls that are on the investigators sides. He is probably their mentor.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="20508"></a><p>It's strange that the answer from yesterday still points this out as mere speculation. I'm up to date with the manga, and it has been confirmed by other characters (ghouls) that</p>

  <p> Haise is indeed Kaneki. </p>

<p>especially in chapter 72...</p>
