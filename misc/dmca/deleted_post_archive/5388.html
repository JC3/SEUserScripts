<td class="post-cell"><a name="5388"></a><p>I'm wondering at what point in the anime series of Bleach do each of the movies occur? This way, when I watch the series I can stop at a specific point to watch the appropriate movie.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="5402"></a><p>At the main story, the movies are never mentioned because they are like fillers. But it's possible to verify when they occur by some facts, by some situations that we saw in the movie:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first movie, Memories of Nobody: Ichigo is able to use his
bankai in the World of the Living, so it happens after the Bount Invasion arc and before the Arrancar one, as he's still unable to use his hollow form. So, it is between <strong>episode 109 &amp; 110</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The second movie, The Diamond Dust Rebellion: Ikkaku use his bankai,
so maybe it happens after the first invasion of Arrancars (the one
defeated by Toshiro team) and before they entering in Hueco mundo. In episodes, <strong>something near 138</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The third movie, Fade to black: I think it happens nearly to the
Diamond Dust Rebellion, during the Arrancar's fight, but before they
entering in Hueco Mundo, because Ichigo still use the first form of
his hollow mask: <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pzq8E.png" alt="enter image description here"></p></li>
<li><p>The forth movie: The Hell Verse: In this movie Ichigo uses the second
form of his mask and transforms into his full hollow form, so he
already fought Ulquiorra in Hueco Mundo and returned. Repeating, its
like a filler, <strong>after episode 299</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If I missed something, please remind me.</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">How is Ichigo able to fight in the fourth movie if his powers disappeared after the aizen fight, and this was before the fullbringer arc based on his shihakusho. It just doesn't fit into the timeline anywhere. But it was a great movie.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; user8428 on 2014-09-22 04:48:22</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">@user8428 It's not supposed to fit. And Kubo has washed his hands of the hell movie, so there's even less reason to expect any cohesion.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; zibadawa timmy on 2014-09-22 11:50:59</span></div>

<div><span class="comment-text">Yes, they start fight in Hueco mundo at chapter 266 to 272. Then, at chapter 286, Ichigo manage to return to protect Karakura and fight Aizen.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Rikkin on 2013-12-26 17:38:10</span></div>
