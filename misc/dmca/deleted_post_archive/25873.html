<td class="post-cell"><a name="25873"></a><p>I was looking though some images on my computer and found this one</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TLxh3.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TLxh3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>i can't remember where i got it from but i was reminded of that it appeared that some of the made up country names like Fuso and Orassia seemed to resemble that of real world locations such as Japan and Russia.</p>

<p>So i am wondering, in Strike Witches what are all the made up countries and if they have real world counterparts?</p>

<p>NOTE: i should point out that i don't know if the image i have has every country on it. if there are other countries in the Strike Witches Universe then i would like them listed too.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="25925"></a><p>I haven't seen Strike Witches, but from looking at the names of the countries and characters in the image, I think I know what most of them are.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fuso is Japan, since all the Fuso characters have Japanese names. I don't know where they get the name "Fuso", though.</li>
<li>Orussia is Russia.</li>
<li>Gallia is France. The characters have French names, and the word "Gallia" comes from a Roman province which included modern-day France.</li>
<li>Hispania is Spain. The name comes from the Roman name for the Iberian peninsula, which includes modern-day Spain and Portgual.</li>
<li>Romagna is Italy. The word comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romagna" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a Latin term for "land inhabited by Romans"</a> and refers to a modern-day region in Northern Italy.</li>
<li>Britannia is England. "Britannia" was the Roman term for the region of the British Isles inhabited by the Britons, and was later used to refer to the nation of Great Britain. This usage was also seen in Code Geass. The characters all have English names.</li>
<li>Liberion is the United States. The character Charlotte Yeager is a pretty clear reference to American pilot Chuck Yeager, one of the first pilots to fly faster than sound. The <a href="http://strikewitches.wikia.com/wiki/Liberion" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Strike Witches wiki</a> also claims that Liberion is an analogue for the US.</li>
<li>Suomus is Finland. The characters' names are all Finnish. The word "Suomus" seems to come from "Suomi", which is the Finnish language's own word for itself.</li>
<li>Karlsland is Germany. Specifically it seems to represent the German Empire as it existed before the First World War.</li>
</ul>

<p>The wiki also has a map of the Strike Witches world that shows several other countries, almost all analogous to real world countries. In general it looks very similar to our world around the time World War I broke out.</p>
