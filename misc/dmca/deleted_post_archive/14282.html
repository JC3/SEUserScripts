<td class="post-cell"><a name="14282"></a><p>I want to start watching One Piece again but don't want to start from the beginning. I know most of the beginning where they assemble a crew and fight Arlong, Buggy, Crocodile. </p>

<p>I want to start at a point where all the big badass characters like Ace and WhiteBeard are involved while still knowing what's going on.  Where's the best episode to start on? </p>

<p>I prefer dubs but when it gets good I can do subs too.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="14321"></a><p>It's difficult to give an objective answer, so I'll summarize the arcs to give you an understanding where you should start watching without giving too much spoiler. I'll stick to recurring characters and exclude filler arcs, as I haven't watched those. For the exact episode numbers refer to <a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Arcs">this page</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to skip to where <em>all the big badass characters like Ace and WhiteBeard are involved</em> you should <strong>skip to the Marineford Arc</strong>. In that arc you will see an all-out war going down between Whitebeard and the Marines to save Ace. I would recommend you to <strong>start at the Sabaody Archipelago Arc</strong> though, where a lot of new characters were introduced that will recur in the story. You could skip inbetween arcs if you want. If you would do so, you'd only have missed the introduction of Franky and Brook and the backstory on Robin.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="14283"></a><p>You can find <em>One Piece</em> episodes to watch on <a href="http://www.hulu.com/one-piece" rel="nofollow">Hulu</a>.</p>

<p>Crocodile is at the end of season 2, so you will want to start from season 3. Ace also shows up in season 3 from the thumbnails on Hulu.</p>

<p>Most of the episodes are <a href="http://www.hulu.com/grid/one-piece?categories=subtitled" rel="nofollow">subbed</a>, but season 3 and 5 are <a href="http://www.hulu.com/grid/one-piece?categories=dubbed" rel="nofollow">dubbed</a> (season 4 is not available dubbed for whatever reason).</p>

<p>Another popular site to watch is CrunchyRoll, you can watch <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/one-piece/episode-136-zenny-of-the-island-of-goats-and-the-pirate-ship-in-the-mountains-651953" rel="nofollow">Season 3</a> there, too. However, all the episodes are subbed.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="14293"></a><p>I am biased and would prefer to watch it from the beginning... largely because I love the show and want to do that myself if I had the time.  Nevertheless, you don't need to watch everything in order to know what is going on now. The start of each arc is an acceptable place to try and pick up the show (though you will miss things obviously).</p>

<p><strong>I would recommend that you start from episode 382</strong>, you will get to know the whole crew a just after they are finally assembled. Before this point there are several entertaining arcs in which the crew progresses through the East Blue and then Grand Line fighting Big Bads and gathers new members.  The current crew becomes whole in episode 381.  You get to see them in one arc together (which provides very important information) and then BIG things happen.  You will meet the characters who are the big players in the world as Luffy does and will get quick overviews of the now underpowered big bads from he previous arcs. This is a major turning point for the show and I don't think there is another good place to pick it up again until episode 517.  If you start there you will have missed the exact badasses you want to see.</p>

<p>Additionally, I would recommend you watch Strong World.  It is a canon movie between (i think) episodes 381 and 382.</p>

<p>Do not think, however, that I am saying that the first 381 episodes are not worth watching.  They are amazing and provide important backstory to every character.</p>

<p>I prefer subs and don't know where to find dubs anywhere but Hulu. Sorry for not being able to answer that part.</p>
