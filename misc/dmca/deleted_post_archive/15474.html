<td class="post-cell"><a name="15474"></a><p>It's been a while seen I last watched <a href="/questions/tagged/haganai" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'haganai'" rel="tag">haganai</a> and <a href="/questions/tagged/oreimo" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'oreimo'" rel="tag">oreimo</a>, and I remember there was a cameo role in a certain episode. Problem is, I don't even remember in which of the two anime and season it happened, just that there was a cameo of the main group of characters.</p>

<p>Can someone point out to me where it appeared and what happened in the cameo? Also, was it reciprocated by the other anime in the pair?</p>

<p><a href="http://haganai.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_11#Trivia" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wikia also mention this cameo</a><br>
I found some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIF4srmD0Nw" rel="nofollow noreferrer">YouTube video</a> about this but it's in Spanish sub</p>
