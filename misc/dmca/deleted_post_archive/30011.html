<td class="post-cell"><a name="30011"></a><p>I've finished watching the Anime's First Season and I noticed that every episode in the anime has different ending themes.</p>

<p>As you can see in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Heaven%27s_Lost_Property_episodes" rel="nofollow">list of episodes</a>. Heaven's lost property has different ending sequences and different ending themes for a 12-episode series anime. Is there a significant reason for this?</p>
