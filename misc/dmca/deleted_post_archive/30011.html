<td class="post-cell"><a name="30011"></a><p>I've finished watching the Anime's First Season and I noticed that every episode in the anime has different ending themes.</p>

<p>As you can see in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Heaven%27s_Lost_Property_episodes" rel="nofollow">list of episodes</a>. Heaven's lost property has different ending sequences and different ending themes for a 12-episode series anime. Is there a significant reason for this?</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">There is not a particular reason for this. There have been several animes which did that. (ie: In lucky star, the endings are completely different each episode, in the monogatari series and Yosuga no Sora the EDs are different per mini arc(3-4eps), in Rokka no Yuusha the Eds have the same song but the video changes based on each character,etc) .</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; thePiGrepper on 2016-02-27 11:35:00</span></div>

<div><span class="comment-text">So they use different endings continuing from the episode. Maybe it was just the studios preferences</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Maka Albarn on 2016-04-27 00:56:34</span></div>
