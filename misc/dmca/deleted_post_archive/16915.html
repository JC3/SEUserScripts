<p>Is it because Hunter x Hunter is already finished?</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="16917"></a><p>Hunter X Hunter Anime is not yet done. According to Togashi, he says he's on hiatus and that he's eventually continuing but the demand from the manga company is too much stress for him and he doesn't want to continue. The quota he has to fill is a chapter a week which is a lot for anyone in the manga industry.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="16926"></a><p>As what Miramiel stated, the mangaka of Hunter X Hunter, Togashi Yoshihiro is on an <em>indefinite</em> hiatus but will be back eventually.</p>

<p>However, it is worth nothing that the reason behind this hiatus is the mangaka's <strong>illness</strong>. Togashi has been experiencing serious back problems 
(sources: <a href="http://www.fandompost.com/2014/09/05/yoshihiro-togashi-extends-hunter-x-hunter-manga-hiatus/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">FANDOM</a>, <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-09-04/hunter-hunter-manga-hiatus-continues-until-further-notice/.78384" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ANN-1</a>, <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-08-28/hunter-x-hunter-manga-extends-hiatus-at-least-1-more-week/.78119" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ANN-2</a>)
which have caused him numerous <em>short</em> breaks over the years. This illness (along with chest pains and sleep loss) has been with him for a quite a while and may have started back when he was still doing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YuYu_Hakusho" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Yuyu Hakusho</a></p>

<p>These back problems, particularly in the lower back area - makes it hard for a mangaka to deliver weekly chapters. When this condition worsened this year, he was forced to take a hiatus. The <strong>anime</strong> will not progress with the mangaka's storyline nor will it be filled with <em>fillers</em> because Togashi would not allow it (and frankly, it would be a waste). It is also <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/2hdxi8/why_cant_yoshihiro_togashi_dictate_what_happens/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">rumored</a> that Togashi could just ask an assistant/s to draw Hunter X Hunter with his storyline but chooses not to for various reasons. </p>
