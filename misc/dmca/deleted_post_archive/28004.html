<td class="post-cell"><a name="28004"></a><p>The question is similar to <a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/27987/what-was-the-name-of-the-song-in-one-piece-episode-722">this one</a> but the song I'm looking for is different. I'm looking for the song that started approximately at 12:28 in episode 722. It begins when Doflamingo begins speaking. The voices cover some parts, but I like the song a lot.</p>

<p>As of now, it's named "Doflamingo's Theme" and you can listen to it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9S3iwvaENc" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>I'll update this answer once the OST has been officially released.</p>
