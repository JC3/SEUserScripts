<td class="post-cell"><a name="8824"></a><p>I have been searching for this for a while now after I finished watching the series a week ago, but I can't find a rough answer on Google and sites such as answers.yahoo.com about which chapter of the manga picks up roughly around the end of episode 25 of Attack on Titan.</p>

<p>Which manga chapter will be a continuation from where episode 25 left off, and how accurate will it be? Does anyone know?</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="8826"></a><p>May I assume you meant in "which chapter"? Because if we said "which manga", well, surely it's in the main manga, <strong>Shingeki no Kyojin</strong>. True that the series now has many spin offs, but the anime is based on the main series, and as far as I remember, all of those spin offs came out after the hype caused by the anime.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=47446">Shingeki no Kyojin Mangaupdates Page</a>:<br>
<em>Anime Start/End Chapter</em><br>
Starts at Vol 1, Chap 1<br>
Ends at Vol 8, Chap 34<br>
So you can start at chapter 35...</p>
