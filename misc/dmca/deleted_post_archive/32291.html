<td class="post-cell"><a name="36341"></a><p>I assume this is referring to when the colossal titan appears in the prologue before the intro.</p>

<p>The song is called <strong>cóunter・attàck-mˈænkάɪnd (Counterattack Mankind)</strong> and is from <strong>Attack on Titan Original Soundtrack</strong>.</p>

<p>The actual part featured in the mentioned scene starts over half way through the track at around <strong>3:25</strong>, which is possibly why it is hard to find.</p>

<p>It is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano.</p>

<p>The track can be found here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PuP7IkpRLU" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PuP7IkpRLU</a></p>
