<td class="post-cell"><a name="33725"></a><p>It seems that after Rurouni Kenshin (1995), there are more stories. But I don't know what to watch because it shows that Kenshin and Kaoru has a baby, Kenshin's past and also that Kaoru was kidnapped by some guys hiding a grudge on Kenshin.</p>

<p>But I'm not sure if there is a movie or different part of the series like season two or something.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="33727"></a><p>The final arc of the <i>Rurouni Kenshin</i> manga is indeed about a man, Enishi, who has an old grudge against Kenshin. <b>However, the final arc of the manga was never put into the anime.</b> There do exist two OVA series that adapt this part of the anime.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rurouni_Kenshin:_Trust_%26_Betrayal" rel="nofollow"><i>Trust and Betrayal</i></a> OVAs adapts the backstory of the final arc, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rurouni_Kenshin:_Reflection" rel="nofollow"><i>Reflection</i></a> OVAs adapts the final arc, though it only appears as a lengthy flashback. The main story of <i>Reflection</i> takes place after the manga. </p>

<p>Both sets of OVAs are drastically different in style and tone from the manga and anime, and lots of content from the manga is not present due to the brevity of the OVAs. That being said, they were highly praised. They were released in English under the <i>Samurai X</i> name.</p>
