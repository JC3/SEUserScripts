<div><span class="comment-text">Skippable or not depends on the taste of the person watching. Your question is opinion based IMHO.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Ayase Eri on 2015-07-24 03:49:51</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">Questions somewhat like this have been asked on SFF.SE with regards to Star Trek, but they usually focused specifically on which episodes were essential to understand later episodes. If you could narrow this down to something like "Which episodes of Fairy Tail do I need to watch to understand [whatever the current arc is]?", it might be permissible, as that can be answered more or less objectively. For now I'm voting to close as primarily opinion-based.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; Torisuda on 2015-07-24 04:37:20</span></div>
<div><span class="comment-text">highly recommend you to do not skip filler ,because even though its filler characters on filler episodes  or arcs are reoccurring.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; menaka on 2016-04-09 09:37:13</span></div>
