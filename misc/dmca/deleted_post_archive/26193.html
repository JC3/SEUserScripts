<td class="post-cell"><a name="26193"></a><p>I'm not a big One Piece fan, but I did watch episode 303 of One Piece on Toonami, because I was bored. Now, in episode 303 "Chase the Vanished Great Sakura Tree", these guys steal a tree that had some kind of significance to the Straw Hat people. </p>

<p>I understand that the tree like lives forever, so I know how the tree was able to live, even after being uprooted, but do they ever explain HOW THAT TREE GOT ON AND OFF THAT BOAT? I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, GUYS! HOW?!</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="26196"></a><p>This entire episode is a little goofy, even for One Piece. This owes to the fact that it's a special episode set in an alternate universe of One Piece, and has no significance towards the actual storyline.  </p>

<p>As far as how they were able to get it on the ship? They simply dug it up and put it there of course! The One Piece world is usually pretty good about explaining things but in specials like this it's mostly meant to get you to laugh at the various gags.  There is no reason to overthink it more than that.</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">I was looking for an actual explanation, or maybe a theory. And you gave a lot of unneeded information.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; DezNutzRLegendary on 2015-09-26 22:10:01</span></div>
