<p>Below are my research as I post this question.</p>

<hr>

<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoyu#Light_novels">Wikipedia</a>, the original light novel series has finished serialization in 2012 with 8 volumes in total:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>01 <em>“Become My property, Hero” “I Refuse!”</em> (「この我のものとなれ、勇者よ」「断る!」)</li>
  <li>02 <em>Conspiracy of Kurultai</em> (忽鄰塔（クリルタイ）の陰謀)</li>
  <li>03 <em>Expeditionary force of Seiken</em> (聖鍵（せいけん）遠征軍)</li>
  <li>04 <em>What Can be Done With These Hands</em> (この手でできること)</li>
  <li>Episode 01 <em>Episode1 Female Magician from Elms country</em> (エピソード1 楡の国の女魔法使い)</li>
  <li>05 <em>The other side of the hill</em> (あの丘の向こうに)</li>
  <li>Episode 00 <em>Episode0 Archer from Dune country</em> (エピソード0 砂丘の国の弓使い)</li>
  <li>Episode 02 <em>Episode2 Female Knight from Flowers country</em> (エピソード2 花の国の女騎士)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The 3 "episodes" are likely side stories (or prequel?) to the main story. That makes the whole of main story contained within 5 volumes.</p>

<p>The last episode of the anime doesn't seem to suggest that the story has ended (rather, it seems to plant seeds for future events):</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> The Central Nation and the Church is going to start the third Holy Crusade, and it was revealed that the Central Nation and the Church has been working with one of the Demonic Clans to keep the war going.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Maou called for meeting of all Greater Races (クリルタイ), but how the meeting plays out is not mentioned. Knowing how the expectation of the Demonic Races and Maou's philosophy to be mismatched, we can assume that the meeting has not taken place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>"クリルタイ"</strong> is mentioned in the last episode, which is part of the title of volume 2 of light novel series (忽鄰塔（<strong>クリルタイ</strong>）の陰謀). This seems to suggest that the 12 anime episodes only uses up 1 volume worth (!) of the light novel series.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="11379"></a><p>The first season of Maoyuu Maou Yuusha animated up to <strong>Chapter 6 of Volume 2</strong> of the Light Novel.</p>

<p>Here are a few quotes for comparison purpose (English translation by NanoDesu):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>From <em>Volume 2 Chapter 5</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hero: “Eh?” Waves “Like that?”</p>
  
  <p>The Chief Maid: “Do something impressive, something fierce!”</p>
  
  <p>The Hero: “Hmm. What should I ... Aha! Titan-class Grand Destruction Plasma Annihilator!!”</p>
  
  <p>Magic swirls through the air ... Searing heat and massive explosions .... Bricks falling all around</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Demon King: “Today, I declare the mustering of the Great Demon Conference, the Kurultai!”</p>
  
  <p>Demon King! Demon King! Demon King!</p>
  
  <p>Finally this day has come!</p>
  
  <p>We’re going to go all out on these Humans! It’ll be our great and utter victory!</p>
  
  <p>The Demon King: “Uhh, wait, no—“</p>
  
  <p>Demon King! Demon King! Long live the King! Long live the King!</p>
  
  <p>The Demon King: “... Umm, all will be decided at the Kurultai! Spread the word to the farthest corners of the world! The Demon King calls!”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>From <em>Volume 2 Chapter 6</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Demon King: “I love the Hero. As the one who owns me, and as a man.”</p>
  
  <p>The Female Paladin: “I love the Hero. As the owner of my sword, and as a man.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Demon King: “Have you seen the proclamation from the Kingdom of Winter, Chief Maid?”</p>
  
  <p>The Chief Maid: “Yes.”</p>
  
  <p>The Demon King: “Isn’t it brilliant? Isn’t it wonderful! This is... This is what I’ve been bursting to see. The establishment of the three Fundamental Human Rights to Life, Property and Freedom. It’s not yet the merging of ancient faiths with theology, but this is the beginning of the extension of basic humanity towards universal love for the people around us. Lumen Naturale, this is the Enlightenment... This era was started by an individual girl who, amidst the blood of wounds, pain and spiritual suffering, strove desperately against all odds to find the seeds of the Enlightenment. This isn’t something I taught her. No, even if I had taught her, this isn’t a ‘knowledge’ that can be passed down. Nothing would have come if I had tried to teach her. This girl crossed that wall borne on the light of her very soul.”</p>

It's been a while since I watched it but from what I remember it ended around that point.</p>
