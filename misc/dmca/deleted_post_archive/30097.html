<td class="post-cell"><a name="30097"></a><p>So I just got into Naruto a few months ago and have been binge-watching my way through the entire series. I watch some subbed anime but after watching so many episodes dubbed I just can't get used to subbed episodes. I've gotten to episode 77 and suddenly the dubbing is gone. The dub doesn't start again until episode 140 on Hulu, and I can't seem to find it anywhere online. Did they just never dub those episodes or is there something I'm missing?</p>

<p>If the Episodes you are looking to Stream are not there the other alternative and legal path is to buy the DVDs. Dubbed wise Collections 6-11 have Episodes 66-140. this <a href="http://www.rightstufanime.com/category/DVD?keywords=Naruto%20Shippuden" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RightStuf Search Result</a> <a href="http://www.rightstufanime.com/Naruto-Shippuden-DVD-Set-6-Hyb-Uncut" rel="nofollow noreferrer">has</a> <a href="http://www.rightstufanime.com/Naruto-Shippuden-DVD-Set-7-Hyb-Uncut" rel="nofollow noreferrer">these</a> <a href="http://www.rightstufanime.com/Naruto-Shippuden-DVD-Set-8-Hyb-Uncut" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Collections</a> <a href="http://www.rightstufanime.com/Naruto-Shippuden-DVD-Set-9-Hyb-Uncut" rel="nofollow noreferrer">available</a> <a href="http://www.rightstufanime.com/Naruto-Shippuden-DVD-Set-10-Hyb-Uncut" rel="nofollow noreferrer">to</a> <a href="http://www.rightstufanime.com/Naruto-Shippuden-DVD-Set-11-Hyb-Uncut" rel="nofollow noreferrer">buy</a>, they ship internationally but the DVDs are Region 1, which is fine if you are in the US or have the equipment/programs to use Region 1 DVDs (ie. a Region Free Player). </p>

<p>if you are in Australia then <a href="https://www.madman.com.au/series/view/15388/naruto-shippuden" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Madman</a> list some of these collections but not all of them (no idea why they just stop after Collection 8)</p>
