<td class="post-cell"><a name="28449"></a><p>I just finished episode 12 of the anime and I'm under the impression that this is the end of season 1. I'd like to continue with the manga now. I don't want to read the remake; I want to read the original webcomic that started in 2009.</p>

<p>Which chapter should I start on? </p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="28450"></a><p>You should start from <strong>Chapter 42</strong> of the original manga.</p>

<p>After the destruction caused by Boros and his defeat by Saitama, the space ship is taken by Metal Knight. The Hero Association HQ is rebuilt.</p>

<p>Chapter 42 picks off with S Class hero, King (ranked 7) <em>facing off</em> a reptile monster and then, Dushimof, a machine god created by the Organisation.</p>
