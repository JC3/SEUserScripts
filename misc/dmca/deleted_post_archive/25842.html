<td class="post-cell"><a name="25842"></a><p>This was <em>briefly</em> shown in episode 5 around 15:49, in between Riki and Komari's night conversation and their date the next day:</p>

<p>What's the meaning of this? Was it meant to be there? Because I don't see it in the English dub.</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="25845"></a><p>The image is rather typical of an advertisement of some anime series in Japan. Searching for "Limit Break OP ED" reveals that it's the name of the third OP of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardfight!!_Vanguard" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>Cardfight!! Vanguard</strong></a>. We can further confirm by comparing the blurry words in the middle of the image with the official stylized logo of <em>Cardfight!! Vanguard</em>:</p>

<p><sup>Take note of the similarity of the word Vanguard in red</sup></p>

<p>It would be great to have the original video for comparison, though tracking down the actual advertisement for comparison is quite hard at this point.</p>

<p>As for why an irrelevant advertisement gets in the middle of a <em>Little Busters</em> episode, I'm rather sure it only appears in the release by a fansub group. In the original Japanese broadcast, it's typical to have a few advertisement in the middle of the show, and whoever in charge of encoding the video failed to trim off this frame from the original transport stream.</p>
