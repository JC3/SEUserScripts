<td class="post-cell"><a name="7936"></a><p>In 2013, they announced there would be a 3rd season for Heaven's Lost Property. Not too long after, they also announced the production crew, and a bit after that an on-hold notice. After that, I haven't been able to find any information about it.</p>

<p>Is it still on hold? Has it been canceled? Or something different altogether?</p>

<p><strong>Quick Plot Summary / Overview:</strong> The scene opens with the Zeus' destruction above Synapse, Tomoki calls for Nymph to return immediately; unfortunately Ikaros responds that Nymph isn't coming. Tomoki commands Ikaros to take him straight to Synapse as the Earth's surface deliberately vanishes. While flying towards Synapse, Ikaros tells Tomoki a story how long ago due to malfunction she was once ordered by a "boy" to attack Synapse out of desperation. Remarking a dying Sugata, Ikaros' body begins burning away because of a device installed within her whenever she approaches Synapse without permission. Having second thoughts, Tomoki orders Ikaros to go back but cannot since there is nowhere else to go to.</p>
