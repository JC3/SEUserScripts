<td class="post-cell"><a name="34060"></a><p>It's the first time I've ever seen an anime series who's released all his episodes in one day and not one episode every week as it is normally.</p>

<p>Is there a reason behind this unique act and are there any other episodes who're going to be released in the future?</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="34079"></a><p>I think CrunchyRoll and other streaming companies are looking at the full-release model more now that it is a regular feature of Netflix.</p>

<p>Netflix has done a lot of internal work on retention analysis - both for keeping paid subscribers, and for series watchers themselves (as that will increase the subscribers' enjoyment and reduce their consideration to leave).  I couldn't find any figures on this, but I presume the drop-off rate of series is lower when episodes are all released at once - Viewers can watch more than a single episode in their first viewing, meaning they will be more involved in the plot by the time they next sit down to watch something.</p>

<p>The way the Crunchyroll model works, the episodes were only available to premium members during the first few weeks of release - this might have also convinced users to subscribe.</p>

<p>While Netflix has done this primarily to non animated works, Re:Life is not the first instance of this bundled release. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/ie/title/80075595">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a> was released in this form earlier this year.</p>
