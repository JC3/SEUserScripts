<td class="post-cell"><a name="18529"></a><p>When the bears go up for trial in the Yuri Court, they argue over whether the bears should be allowed to eat the humans. In the first two episodes, the bears are given permission, but despite Ginko claiming that she will eat Kureha, she has still yet to.</p>

<p>Other humans end up being eaten, but why are they asking to eat Kureha, but then eating someone else? Surely they have only asked to eat her?</p>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="18772"></a><p>Best explanation I've seen is something like:</p>

<p>"Will you be invisible?" - Will you be unaccepted by society.</p>

<p>"Will you eat humans?" - Will you be accepted as a monster.</p>

<p>The girls are being judged by men in bear court - Japan's still a largely patriarchal society.</p>

<p>Basically, if society can treat them as monsters for having the sort of romantic feelings they want, then society will accept them, feelings and all.  Thought the "eat" metaphor was fairly straightforward in context.  o.o;</p>

<p>Some reviewer made a great, step-by-step post covering the second episode.  Whole anime's stuffed with metaphor cleverly twisted by literal interpretation (fictional / literal double entendre).  Pretty fun!^^</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">I dunno who Joe is referring to, but http://8ths.in/ was basically required reading for Mawaru Penguindrum (though his MPD posts are in limbo somewhere at the moment), and he said he'll be posting about Yurikuma Arashi (he has a post about episode 1 out so far), so that's definitely worth a look.</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; senshin on 2015-01-23 16:18:50</span></div>
