<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Byakuya on a wall with blood splattered everywhere, and a man with white hair (sorry for me not knowing his name; I have yet to actually read the manga, besides the first three volumes) says, "It seems Byakuya Kuchiki is dead."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is: is Byakuya <em>really</em> dead, here, or does he come back and whatnot? This scene <em>looks</em> as though he is, but we've seen desperate situations-like this-in the past chapters (or episodes) of Bleach where the character isn't <strong>truly</strong> dead; they come back later making a dramatic entrance, looking even more badass than before. See what I mean?</p>

<p>This <strong><em>CAN'T</em></strong> be the end for Byakuya Kuchiki. It just can't!</p>

<div><span class="comment-text">Hmm... you could answer with a "yes/no". Hahaha. I'm not looking for anything complicated; this is just something my sister and I wanted to know ASAP. And I'm sure anybody else who wants the answer doesn't want anything complicated, but put enough so that the people here don't delete your answer. -_- Go ahead and make it a spoiler. ;)</span> <span class="comment-info">&mdash; DezNutzRLegendary on 2016-01-03 04:32:42</span></div>

<td class="post-cell"><a name="28622"></a><p>You should probably just live with the dramatic tension as you keep reading through the series.  That being said...</p>

<p>The short answer:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> He gets better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The slightly longer answer:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> He gets better.  And gets a power-up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The longer, more detailed answer:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> He hangs on by a thread.  And then Squad Zero--recall we heard about them during the Turn Back The Pendulum arc--shows up when the Quincies leave.  One of them takes Byakuya and a few others with them up to the Royal Palace.  Byakuya and a few others then get healed up, equipped, and trained in the Royal Palace.</p>

<p>I left a fair amount of details out of the above, so some things won't be spoiled, but it still spoils a fair amount even in its vague brevity.</p>

<p>And he shows up in chapter 655.</p>
