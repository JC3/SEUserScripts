<td class="post-cell"><a name="30964"></a><p>After episode 277 (counting from the 2014 restart, around episode 102), there are no listed episodes in list of Fairy Tail episodes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fairy_Tail_episodes" rel="nofollow">on Wikipedia</a>. It's due to have some new OVA as well, but the anime did not give a clear indication like the last time that it is going to hiatus.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it on hiatus right after episode 277(counting from 2014, episode 102)?</li>
<li>Did Hiro Mashima gave some indication (like last time) that it will be back and when it will be back?</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>After making its premiere in April 2014, this season is finally <strong>coming to an end</strong> after 101 episodes, with the <strong>final episode</strong> to be released on March 26.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The current season of the anime may be nearing its end, but reports suggest that a <strong>new project is in the works</strong>, with the publisher of the manga, Kodansha's Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine, slated to officially <strong>reveal the rumored project</strong> in its 17th issue of the year on March 23.

  <p>Kodansha did not hint at what the new project will be, but <strong>this is not the end for the Fairy Tail anime.</strong>  This is most likely a hiatus, similar to the one that was taken in 2013.

  <p>They stopped airing the anime in the year 2013 and came back in the year 2014. So majority of fans expect this Hiatus <strong>to be a year long.</strong>

<p>One of the reasons that may have caused it is the fact that the anime is close to the manga and in order to avoid changing the story( see Full Metal Achemist 2003 and Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood)  they've chose to let the manga go ahead in order to have the original source material.</p>
