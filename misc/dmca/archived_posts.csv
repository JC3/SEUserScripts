"24337","2","","8469","2015-08-25 05:16:48","","-3","","<p>Well, it seems like Natsume has been reincarnated, but for some reason, Harutora had to leave her behind, right? The obvious answer is, he did something taboo, forbidden, and there seems to be some unfinished business with the Taizan Fukun ritual, which makes it logical that he make his escape so that he could finish what he started. </p>

<p>Also, it seems logical for Natsume to be left behind like that...I mean if you think about it, Harutora must have sacrificed something bigger than life to dabble on something as taboo as resurrecting the dead--which in any other anime I've seen--is more seriously labeled as evil magic. </p>

<p>Given Natsume's character, she wouldn't have allowed Harutora to do something like that--in fact, she had already voiced her objections back when Suzuka attempted to use the same ritual. This reason alone puts Harutora in a precarious situation where he must resurrect Natsume against her consent. Her objecting to the process might only complicate things and distract him from his--should we call it romantic or obsessive--goal of prolonging her life or resurrecting her completely as a normal human being. </p>

<p>If I were Harutora, it would be too frightening to face someone you love only to tell her that her life depends on certain `uncertainties' including the help of other-worldly gods, demons, or what-have-you and doing all that for what reason? For love that is pure and true? I don't think Harutora even has the slightest understanding of what he truly feels for Natsume, though the fact that he does feel something profoundly and frighteningly deep is itself beyond doubt...</p>

<p>Having said that, I'd probably put on my best sneakers and prepare to run, if only to save myself from the embarrassingly disturbing explanations--and confessions--I'd have to make to satisfy Natsume's excruciatingly probing curiosity.. </p>

<p>Finally, if Harutora had to sacrifice himself eventually, as that could be the only possibility left to complete the ritual, I'm sure he wouldn't want to do it right in front of her. He knew what that felt like, having witnessed Natsume's death first-hand, and being the cause of it too. I think he wouldn't hesitate to give up everything for her, but just so he didn't have to feel so bad about it, he could do that on his own, like some supreme, heroic sacrifice that nobody should interfere with, especially Natsume, who might reject that offering--a rejection that to Harutora would be even more tragic because as is surprisingly obvious, he's just that kind of guy who doesn't know when to give up. Or maybe it's just the case of stubborn true love? </p>

<p>What's clear is that he is unwilling to go on with his own existence without Natsume, as is obvious when he touched the missing pentagram on his upper left cheek right after the death incident and mourned her loss crying out her name repeatedly--something he was only able to do when he was imprisoned by Kurahashi/Yashimaru in the Onmyou Agency headquarters. </p>

<p>The feeling that somebody has to die somewhere down the road towards Natsume's final resurrection depresses me as this seems ominous from the very start... That Harutora might have to figuratively die to give way to Yakou's complete awakening as a means to perfecting the forbidden ritual is a strong possibility, then there's the more poignant possibility of Natsume giving up her life to free Harutora from the obligation he had set upon himself to resurrect her, especially when she realizes eventually the depth of his sacrifice... I don't know which way the story might go, but there's bound to be something romantically tragic in the end... and it almost makes me reluctant to know how everything might really turn out... huh, talk about 50 shades of reincarnation, right?                     </p>

"38077","2","","195","2016-12-26 23:07:12","","0","","<p>For some reason I had a hard time believing that the robot was not Okazaki because of the voice it had. It just was not the same. Whenever he talks or thinks his voice is the same out loud. Why aren't they same. Sure you could say for the sake of plot so it wouldn't be obvious, but didn't Ushio sound similar. I'm pretty sure that if Ushio had grown up she would have sounded like that. So why isn't Okazaki? Some might say he could sound like a child, but we've heard his voice as a child before and he sounds nothing like that. (During the episode when Kotomi and Okazaki first become friends).</p>

<p>Doesn't the robots voice sound an awful lot like Shima? The kid that made a promise to Misae when they were high school and promised to stay with her. I don't doubt that the girl is Ushio but it'd make the most sense. You never knew much about Shima and his back story is very interesting. The robot never replies when the girl calls him dad. But then again the robot claimed to have heard of the Dango song. But the Dango family song was very famous in Japan but it was never specified during what time period and we can assume it was during the time Nagisa and Okazaki were kids since Okazaki kept referring to the Dango song as childish,and old. If that were true then it would fit the time period that Misae and Shima went to high school, since Misae isn't very old. Shima would make sense since he had apparently died already, just like Ushio, and claimed to have the power to grant any wish. From a pouch with a glowing light inside. Maybe the source is a glowing orb. He apparently was suffering from an illness and was being hospitalized, could it have been the same condition Nagisa and Ushio faced? Problem is he's completely foreign. We aren't even completely sure if he is Shima.</p>

<p>Regarding the end of Clannad After Story, I just thought that Okazaki had died due to him collapsing in the snow and was reliving his life right before he died and imagined the best case scenario, seeing how he did that during a card game with fuuko and ushio or that when he passed away that him and his family were reunited in the afterlife, only problem would be the 22 episode that theory is contradicted with ushio laying in the grass at the end of it, but then in the last three episodes it focuses on their pasts maybe implying that their all dead. Ushio may have survived seeing how she was at the same place Nagisa's dad took her when she was facing certain death due to similar circumstances the hospital (highly doubt it though) But then I remembered something major, in a dream I pretty sure Kyou told him that he had Schizophrenia, and that's a bid deal. Schizophrenia is a brain disorder where the mind has a hard time separating reality from fantasy. Could the other world just be a figure of his imagination, a result from Schizophrenia? It was stated in his own dream, maybe a clue or hint to what's really going on. While they were children Kotomi and Okazaki always played with each other. Maybe she told him about her parents research. If that's true he could have been developing this story for a long time in his mind from the time since he was a child. The ending of Nagisa's version was much different to Okazaki.   </p>

<p>The orbs of light I thought were symbolic of the connection the story had with reality that ultimately Okazaki and ushio would be separated only to be reunited in a better place. Similar to the fortune telling in a way. The other worlds kinda felt a bit far fetched seeing how this anime didn't seem to focus its plot lines in that kinda stuff but lean towards problems based off society issues and not other worldly issues (amazing vocabulary I know) The other worlds I felt were focused to Kotomi but I'm still unsure about that, but I agree on the theory that it seemed that Nagisa and Ushio can't be in the same world.</p>

<p>Disclaimer this is purely based off the anime not the VN.</p>

"37279","2","","195","2016-11-12 07:55:01","","0","","<p>So, a few things before I answer this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I know I am late </p></li>
<li><p>SPOILER ALERT</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here goes...</p>

<h3>About the orbs of light</h3>

<p>The orbs of light appear when a particular goal is achieved. It has the ability to grant wishes.</p>

<h3>About alternate timelines</h3>

<p>In Clannad, there are alternate timelines where, obviously, things are different. In the OVAs, Tomoya dates Kyou and Tomoyo. These events take place in the alternate timeline. Kotomi's parents were performing a research on the alternate world.</p>

<h3>About the Illusionary world</h3>

<p>In theory, the Illusionary World is the afterlife; when a person dies they are still connected to the real world, yet they are free to create their own world.</p>

<p>The Illusionary World in Clannad was created by Ushio. In the Illusionary World the girl is Ushio and the doll is Tomoya. Tomoya also mentions in an episode that he somehow knows the end of the story that Nagisa told him. The story was about the Illusionary World.</p>

<h3>The ending</h3>

<p>We see that Tomoya had a miserable life. Nagisa and Ushio die, and it wasn't going his way. Later on, Tomoya goes back to the point where he first met Nagisa, and then he marries her and they have a kid. But this time Nagisa survived.</p>

<p>Now there are three possible interpretations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Tomoya was just dreaming of the worst that could happen. But in the end nothing bad happens and everything is okay. </p>

<p>But if this would've happened, then the orbs of light have no role. And the scene where he goes back to the past wouldn't have made sense.</p></li>
<li><p>Nagisa survived in an alternate timeline. But again, the orbs of light have no role.</p>

<p>The scene where he goes back wouldn't make sense either because in that scene Tomoya and Nagisa remember each other... And it wouldn't have been possible even if they were in the alternate timeline.</p></li>
<li><p>This is probably what had happened.
So in the illusionary world we see the orbs of light every now and then. These were collected by Ushio (the girl) and Tomoya (the doll). Tomoya first wished that he shouldn't have met Nagisa. But it wasn't what he really wanted and thus it wasn't granted by the orbs light. What he really wished for was for Nagisa to be alive.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The orbs of light that Ushio collected in the Illusionary World granted this big wish and thus Tomoya is taken back to the past. He didn't say anything to Nagisa. He was in a dilemma here. Nagisa started walking away and at that moment Tomoya made his mind and ran to Nagisa and hugged her. They still remembered each other. Then he is taken to the point where Nagisa gives birth. She survives and they live happily ever after.</p>

<p>Now here both the conditions are satisfied.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The orbs of light grant him his wish </p></li>
<li><p>The scene where he goes back to the past makes sense because he has a faint memory of the terrible thing that happened to him (mentioned by Tomoya in the recap episode)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>People can believe whatever they want. I personally feel the third one makes sense.</p>

<p>If you've made it this far then thank you for reading!</p>

<p>Clannad is really the best anime I've ever watched. Hopefully this clarified things :)</p>

"30888","2","","18739","2016-03-27 07:18:03","","0","","<p>Akame ga Kill, is a dark thriller with a male protagonist, that being said, a lot of media regarding dark emotions doesn't have the main character's attributes in the title. The title references the theme, and is in third person from the protagonist's point of reference (They don't necessarily need to say the title out loud in the media).</p>

<p>In the title ""Death becomes her"" Bruce Willis is the protagonist, kinda dark. ""She lives!"" is about a cancer patient with the BF as the main character and he tries to make her life meaningful in the short time. These types of stories almost always have the main character identify with the titular character and at some point accept them for who they are.</p>

<p>""Akame Ga Kill"" is the main Character's Tatsumi's statement at sometime in this series which ultimately came from his experiences living with a family of assassins; it also can reference to the point that his main inspiration kills/cuts/incises(as in surgery). Tatsumi has to redeem his friends as well as the innocents killed by the evil empire, Akame kills the evil empire, so killing the evil empire has become normal. It is to reference the main theme, and is a clever enough title to reference many themes in the story.</p>

"18742","2","","18739","2015-01-22 05:05:34","","11","","<p>This is straightforward if you know Japanese. 斬る <em>kiru</em> is a verb meaning ""to cut"", with the specific nuance of ""to kill with a blade"". Which is what Akame does, which is why the show is named ""Akame ga Kiru"", which means ""Akame cuts"" or ""Akame kills with a blade"". </p>

<p>The English title ""Akame ga Kill"" is a fortuitous coincidence owing to the fact that the Japanese pronunciation of English ""kill"" is also <em>kiru</em>, and ""kill"" means more or less the same thing as 斬る <em>kiru</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I googled a bit and came across <a href=""http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/2000121-anime-and-manga-other-titles/69737130"">this link</a>, according to which <strong><em>Akame ga Kill!</em></strong> literally means: Akame <em>is</em> kill </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that guy was wrong (or perhaps <a href=""http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/john-is-kill"">a master ruseman</a>). There isn't any interpretation of the title under which it could mean ""Akame is kill"". </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As another user points out, a general translation would be <em>Akame Kills</em>, but that would be a very stupid name, wouldn't it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What's stupid about it? That's what the whole bloody story is about - Akame (and the rest of Night Raid) killing. </p>

<hr>

<p>Now, as for why Akame specifically is the title character, that I don't know. But it is the case that she is the one most wont to killing with a blade (as opposed to, say, a gun or a fist or whatever). Would the title make as much sense if it were ""Tatsumi cuts"" / ""Tatsumi kills with a blade""? No, because he doesn't do that all that much. </p>

<p>Given that they lampoon Akame's lack-of-main-character-ness in the show, I don't know that there's too much to read into this. Maybe she's the title character because the artist liked drawing her on the manga covers or something. It's not like the reason for her being the title character needs to be particularly deep.</p>

It almost felt like a joke at first; being all upset about Spike dying just for the show to remind you, ""You're gonna carry that weight,"" kicking off a period of depression.  The interesting thing about Cowboy Bebop was that it always addressed you at the end (""See you, Space Cowboy"").  That was the part when you (may have) turned off the television, stopped being a observer, and become a participant in reality. ""Carry That Weight"" is about the past, and by coming to the end of Cowboy Bebop, by sticking with the characters, the show has become a part of your past.  For most fans, an important part of the past. A show, a completely made-up story, has caused you emotional triumph and burden.  It's the glory of fiction, really, that it can shape who we are almost as much as life experiences.  Where there's usually a detachment from anime, you're reminded that you're going to face such emotions as Spike, Fay, and Jet had by real-life situations.  You're likely going to have a 23-episode period of happiness, before the last three episodes see the dissolution of old friendships or a visit from the past. Things can never be the same again, such as in the Beatles song Carry That Weight: ""Once there was a way to get back homeward.""  You carry the emotional burden of what was and what could have been.</p>

As such, there isn't any content on which one could base a sequel. </p>

<p>However, it isn't quite the case that the anime covered all the material in the novel - clocking in at around 950 pages of dense prose<sup>2</sup>, the novel contained many bits and pieces that didn't make it into the anime. </p>

<p>Some of this is probably because of restrictions on the kinds of content that can be shown on TV - e.g. somewhere around what would be episode 8, Saki witnesses Satoru and Shun having sex, and this is described in the novel in great detail (though not in a salacious way). </p>

<p>Most omissions, though, were probably just because of constraints on the amount of time available to the anime - <em>Shinsekai Yori</em> is an incredibly detail-rich story, and translating all that detail to the screen would require far more than just 25 episodes of anime. Remember how we got nearly a full episode of infodump from the false minoshiro in episode 4? That's the cut-down-for-TV version of that scene. In the novel, the false minoshiro speaks for around twice as long. </p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> Do note that <em>Shinsekai Yori</em> is an actual novel, not a light novel.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> In the one-volume edition, anyway.</p>

<li><p><a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=11396"" rel=""nofollow"">xxxHOLiC: Rō</a> (OVA), only in japan, 1 Episode</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=12056"" rel=""nofollow"">xxxHOLiC: Rō Adayume</a> (OAV), once again only in japan, 1 Episode</p></li>
</ul>

<p>there is also a xxxHOLiC movie called <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=4212"" rel=""nofollow"">xxxHOLiC the Movie: A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>, numerous releases and from what i've seen in Australia gets released with <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=5148"" rel=""nofollow"">Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE the Movie: The Princess in the Birdcage Kingdom</a> aswell.</p>

<p>Finally, i should forget the <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=2890"" rel=""nofollow"">Manga</a> which is released in English.</p>

<p>the List above is i'm assuming the chronological order as the links all seem to indicate that much but i haven't seen the series myself however xxxHOLiC ties itself with Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE from my understanding.</p>

<p>To answer you main question <strong>How many seasons are there of xxxHolic</strong> i'd say only 2 Seasons and 4 OVA's (remember Shunmuki has 2 episodes)</p>

<p>Now i have no idea how long the OVA episodes go for however i accept Maria Watches Over Us OVA Season 3 is a season by itself as that has 4 episodes about 40-50 minutes each, in a sense that's about 8-10 regular episodes of a normal series or if xxxHOLiC's episodes OVA episodes are about that you can refer to them as seasons aswell</p>

Ninja-themed anime aren't really my favorite, but Shippuden really appealed to me for some reason, and so I started watching Naruto because it seemed natural to watch before Shippuden. However, I have seen a few of the Naruto movies, and I've seen clips from Shippuden, and it seems like I could just skip Naruto and watch Shippuden because of the many flashbacks that they use. I might just watch Naruto before Shippuden anyway, but I was just curious. 
EDIT: Thanks for the answer! I'm now 117 episodes in, and I'm loving it so far. </p>

<p>There are several reasons of why you should watch the first part (or at least read the manga):</p>

<p><strong>- Character development:</strong></p>

<p>You will start by following the characters since their first days in the academy, and you will start to watch them grow every episode, you will know their life, their personalities, love some, and hate some, you will understand them and how they feel toward each other, and witness every single piece of event that made them arrive to what they are in the Shipudden part. </p>

<p><strong>- Grow in strength:</strong></p>

<p>Starting by the first Naruto part will make you start by seeing the beginners ninja techniques, you will start by seeing that creating a clone is a huge achievement ! And after long episodes and long days of training/fighting, you will start to see the development of each ones techniques and feel the value of it even if it's still small, and that's the most important part in every anime: character development, precisely for this part: the growth in strength (physical and mental). By starting with Shippuden you will start already by large techniques, strong characters, big fights.. and that's not that cool as a start.</p>

<p><strong>- The Story:</strong></p>

<p>Of course if you skip a part of the anime, you will skip a part of the story, precisely the childhood of the famous characters (and it was the fun part of the story, since Shippuden is a part of war).</p>

<p>There are several other points that you can miss by skipping the first part, but as I said first, it's not that you can't watch Shippuden directly, it's that it's better for you to grow with the characters since their first days.</p>

<p><strong>There are many people who wish to lose their Naruto-memory so they can watch it again, you still didn't watch it ! don't waste this chance : )</strong></p>

"14293","2","","14282","2014-10-03 18:27:42","","2","","<p>I am biased and would prefer to watch it from the beginning... largely because I love the show and want to do that myself if I had the time.  Nevertheless, you don't need to watch everything in order to know what is going on now. The start of each arc is an acceptable place to try and pick up the show (though you will miss things obviously).</p>

<p><strong>I would recommend that you start from episode 382</strong>, you will get to know the whole crew a just after they are finally assembled. Before this point there are several entertaining arcs in which the crew progresses through the East Blue and then Grand Line fighting Big Bads and gathers new members.  The current crew becomes whole in episode 381.  You get to see them in one arc together (which provides very important information) and then BIG things happen.  You will meet the characters who are the big players in the world as Luffy does and will get quick overviews of the now underpowered big bads from he previous arcs. This is a major turning point for the show and I don't think there is another good place to pick it up again until episode 517.  If you start there you will have missed the exact badasses you want to see.</p>

<p>Additionally, I would recommend you watch Strong World.  It is a canon movie between (i think) episodes 381 and 382.</p>

<p>Do not think, however, that I am saying that the first 381 episodes are not worth watching.  They are amazing and provide important backstory to every character.</p>

<p>I prefer subs and don't know where to find dubs anywhere but Hulu. Sorry for not being able to answer that part.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1 (For people who have read MSN. If you have not read MSN, skip to part 2)</strong></p>

<p>Remember <a href=""http://negima.wikia.com/wiki/Evangeline_A.K._McDowell"" rel=""nofollow"">Eva</a> from MSN? She is the same person as Yukihime-sensei. Over the years, Eva figured out a way to change her appearance so she could live life more normally - as an adult.
Basically, everyone from MSN presumably died (since ~100 years have passed) except for Eva since she is an immortal vampire.</p>

<p>Chapter 1:</p>

<ul>
<li>Page 1 - Eva gives her introduction  </li>
<li>Page 2 - She shows how the people from MSN are gone now   </li>
<li>Page 5 - Shows her current UQ team   </li>
<li>Page 70 - Eva reveals her true identity to Touta  </li>
</ul>

<p>Chapter 2:</p>

<ul>
<li>Page 16 - Eva reverts back to her 10 year old true form. She stays this way until page 38, where she returns back to her older fabricated form.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>

<p>Both UQ and MSN are related through Eva, although MSN followed Negi's journey (main character of MSN). UQ's story is being told by Eva, who is reflecting on the past. Eva plays an important character in both series, as her role is to train the main characters, Negi and Touta.</p>

<p>Also note that Touta Konoe is Negi Springfield's grandson (Ch 1 Pg 18). Given that his surname is Konoe, we can also assume he is related to Konoka Konoe from MSN as well.</p>

<p>While UQ Holder is the sequel to MSN, there is nothing critical that you have missed. In other words, you can read and understand UQ Holder perfectly fine without reading its prequel. There are the occasional references to MSN though, but they do not affect the plot in any way. </p>

<p>A good analogy for this would be the difference between Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. You can pick up Dragon Ball Z and fully understand everything without watching Dragon Ball. And in this case, UQ Holder and MSN have a time skip of 3 generations later, so every character except Yukihime is presumed dead now.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kjfM2m.png"" alt=""Uryuu&#39;s reaction""> </p>

<p>However, it seems very likely that Mayuri fiddled with Nemu's <em>""reset button""</em><sup>1</sup>, based on her moaning (see screenshot below), and his remark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can't even understand something that simple by looking at it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mq05tm.png"" alt=""Nemu moaning""></p>

<p>He later derides Uryuu and Renji for reaching wrong conclusions, and calls them laymen who do not understand his technology. This suggests that he might have given Nemu something <em>like</em> a Tantric Massage. Laymen watching it in our world would reach exactly the same wrong conclusion. </p>

<p>I know the above theory is a speculation, but this is as much evidence I can provide to support it. I guess we won't know any more of what he did for the reason Uryuu mentions.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Chaos;Head</em> happens in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya"">Shibuya</a> and the events happen one year before <em>Steins;Gate</em></li>
<li><em>Steins;Gate</em> happens in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara"">Akihabara</a></li>
<li><em>Robotic;Notes</em> happens in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanegashima"">Tanegashima</a> Island and the events happen nine years after <em>Steins;Gate</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The events of <em>Chaos;Head</em> are consistent with the events of <em>Steins;Gate</em> within the Beta worldline, divergence ratio: 1.130426%. <em>Steins;Gate</em> and <em>Robotics;Note</em> exist on the ""Steins;Gate"" worldline, divergence ratio: 1.048596%. (<em>Steins;Gate</em> was also originally in the same worldline as <em>Chaos;Head</em>, which changed after Okabe sent the first D-Mail and passed to another worldline.)</p>

<p>There is a mention of ""Knight Hart"" which is the online persona of <em>Chaos;Head</em>'s protagonist Nishijou Takumi, in episode 4 of <em>Steins;Gate</em>. In the <em>Steins;Gate</em> game, it's <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BRHYi.jpg"">mentioned that this character</a> was also looking for the IBN 5100 (the non-conical 8-bit version of the game gets more in depth into his motvations). </p>

<p>Kurisu explained the ""Time Leap Machine"" concept to Okabe using NOZOMI papers from <em>Chaos;Head</em>.</p>

<p>On big TV outdoors, FES's performance can be seen in the Alpha timeline. Giving the right reply to Faris's mail earns the player Ayase's portrait and FES's music, sung by Kanako Itou, which include the <em>Chaos;Head</em> OP, ""Find the Blue."" </p>

<p>There's a Seira-tan cosplay cameo in <em>Steins;Gate</em> as well:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Owtx5.jpg"" alt=""Kururururururrururururururusu-tina!""></p>

<p><em>Robotics;Note</em> connects the two series a bit more by revealing that the ""Committee of 300"" are the driving force between the major events of all three series. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Nae from <em>Steins;Gate</em> appears as an adult in <em>Robotics;Note</em>. Daru and Kurisu show up on the Twipo network in <em>Robotics;Note</em> as ""DaSH"". In the VN game, Kurisu <a href=""http://ibm5100.net/steinswiki/2011/09/09/heroine-qgate/"">uses a tripcode</a>. In the anime, Kurisu posts in @channel under the handle ""<a href=""http://steins-gate.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_Glossary#Term_2:_KuriGohan_and_Kamehameha"">KURI_KAME</a>"" in episode 15 (about 2D and 3D limitations).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>12巻は全体的に美少女ゲーム（ギャルゲー）を意識した構成になっていて、原点に帰った印象を受けます。</p>
  
  <p>I felt that volume 12 [the last volume] was written in a manner informed by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bish%C5%8Djo_game"">galges</a>. It felt like a return to the way it originally was.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fushimi responded:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>そうですね。狙って１巻っぽいシーンを書いています。すべてに決着をつけて禁断の道に突っ込むという痛快な物語は、電撃文庫で、直接描くのは、とても難しいですし、桐乃を幸せにするエンドにしようと決めた以上、彼女の今後には、可能な限り良いレールを敷いてやらなくてはいけないし……非常に悩みました。結果は、読んでいただいたとおりなのですが、再読する方向けに、蛇足ながらコメントさせていただくと、</p>
  
  <p><strong>・「完全なる桐乃エンド」</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>・「最初の人生相談と同じように、兄妹は、二人だけの秘密を抱えて終わる」</strong></p>
  
  <p>１２巻は、そんなお話です。</p>
  
  <p>I guess so. I wrote so that it would have scenes that felt like those in volume 1. With Dengeki Bunko [Fushimi's publisher], it was very difficult to write a thrilling story in which they settle everything and head down a forbidden path. I was sure I would give Kirino a happy ending, so I did my best to set up as good a situation for her as possible, for the sake of her future. I found it very difficult to do so. It ended up the way you read it [in volume 12], but if I were to add a few unnecessary comments for those readers who are reading it for a second time, I would say:</p>
  
  <p>""A Completely Kirino Ending""</p>
  
  <p>""The story ends with the two siblings sharing a secret, the same way their first life-advice-talk [<em>jinsei soudan</em>] began.""</p>
  
  <p>That's basically what volume 12 was about.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>In <a href=""http://ebook.itmedia.co.jp/ebook/articles/1306/20/news020.html"">another interview</a>, Fushimi was asked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>すでに最終巻を読まれた読者には既知の結末になるんですが、エンディングに向けての展開はどういう風に決めていったんですか？</p>
  
  <p>The ending [of the anime] will probably come as a bit of deja vu to those who have already read the novel. How did you decide how the story would reach its end?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excerpted from Fushimi's reply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...]桐乃の想いが完全に報われる結末が[...]ひとつもなかったんです。普段表には出さないし、いろいろな事情があって、分かりやすい形で書いてあげることもできないけれど、彼女がとても主人公のことを想っているのを、僕は知っていたので、何とかしてやりたかった。[...]</p>
  
  <p>In the main story [as contrasted with the PSP game], I couldn't write an ending where Kirino's affection is truly and entirely rewarded. Various circumstances prevented me from plainly writing that sort of ending. Nonetheless, I realized that she cared deeply for [Kyousuke], and so I felt I had to do something for her.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Fushimi's comments strongly suggest that he wanted to write a different ending - presumably a more ""taboo"" one in which Kirino and Kyousuke remain in a relationship - but was prevented from doing so by his publishers. Hence the ""until we graduate"" provision.</p>

I rather think that the sentence Akame ga kill could loosly be translated to: 
Akame has killed.
Following this thought, one could say, that it just means, all kills and bad things the Night Raid did were pinned on Akame, as Akame in episode 24 suggested.
She could be the symbol for all sins commited by the Night Raid.
Instead of making the title ""The Night Raid has killed"", the title reffers to the future and reflects the impression of the uninvolved people such as the villagers form the hometown who still think Tatsumi is alive, they aren't as informed as the soldiers oder the revolutionaries and so it would be possible to make them believe all crimes had been commited by the sole Akame.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Akame ga Kill!</em></strong> (Japanese: アカメが斬る! Hepburn: <em>Akame ga Kiru!</em>, literally meaning ""Red-Eye Kill!"")</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is basis for that, Red = Aka 赤 (アカ) and Eye = Me 目 (メ)</p>

<p>As you can see, the katakana for Akame is used rather than the hiragana since it's used for a character's name so it's describing her perfectly: she has red eyes.</p>

<p>As for the last part, kiru (斬る), while one could just pass it off as a crappy translation to English because it sounds like kill, it apparently does mean kill:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>to kill (a human) using a blade (sword, machete, knife, etc.), to slice (off), to lop (off), to cut (off)</p>
  
  <p>Kanji in this word</p>

<hr>

<p>According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoyu#Light_novels"">Wikipedia</a>, the original light novel series has finished serialization in 2012 with 8 volumes in total:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>01 <em>“Become My property, Hero” “I Refuse!”</em> (「この我のものとなれ、勇者よ」「断る!」)</li>
  <li>02 <em>Conspiracy of Kurultai</em> (忽鄰塔（クリルタイ）の陰謀)</li>
  <li>03 <em>Expeditionary force of Seiken</em> (聖鍵（せいけん）遠征軍)</li>
  <li>04 <em>What Can be Done With These Hands</em> (この手でできること)</li>
  <li>Episode 01 <em>Episode1 Female Magician from Elms country</em> (エピソード1 楡の国の女魔法使い)</li>
  <li>05 <em>The other side of the hill</em> (あの丘の向こうに)</li>
  <li>Episode 00 <em>Episode0 Archer from Dune country</em> (エピソード0 砂丘の国の弓使い)</li>
  <li>Episode 02 <em>Episode2 Female Knight from Flowers country</em> (エピソード2 花の国の女騎士)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The 3 ""episodes"" are likely side stories (or prequel?) to the main story. That makes the whole of main story contained within 5 volumes.</p>

<p>The last episode of the anime doesn't seem to suggest that the story has ended (rather, it seems to plant seeds for future events):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The Central Nation and the Church is going to start the third Holy Crusade, and it was revealed that the Central Nation and the Church has been working with one of the Demonic Clans to keep the war going.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Maou called for meeting of all Greater Races (クリルタイ), but how the meeting plays out is not mentioned. Knowing how the expectation of the Demonic Races and Maou's philosophy to be mismatched, we can assume that the meeting has not taken place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>""クリルタイ""</strong> is mentioned in the last episode, which is part of the title of volume 2 of light novel series (忽鄰塔（<strong>クリルタイ</strong>）の陰謀). This seems to suggest that the 12 anime episodes only uses up 1 volume worth (!) of the light novel series.</p>

This era was started by an individual girl who, amidst the blood of wounds, pain and spiritual suffering, strove desperately against all odds to find the seeds of the Enlightenment.

<blockquote>
  <p>I wonder how long it has been, but thank you for finding this.<br>
  I made an emergency landing on this planet after my spaceship had trouble and was saved by someone here.<br>
  Before I knew, he meant a lot to me. But this is a remote planet where contact with the locals is forbidden. Help will soon be on its way.<br>
  I imagine my memories on this planet will be sealed away to mantain secrecy .<br>
  But... I wanted... to leave behind the memories I had with him, no matter what.<br>
  Even if my memories faded, even if I couldn't remember, I wanted to leave something behind. Thank you for finding it.<br>
  I pray that at least my memories will live on with you.<br>
  Please don't forget.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comparing the text above with the story of Onegai Teacher, if it was left behind by Kazami Mizuho, it should be before she is recalled into HQ and everyone's memories are wiped out. One thing that does not click is that it seems like an accident. Mizuho came to earth on an observer assignment (contrast with Ichika, that came on a ""tourist visa"").</p>

<p>Some of the alien's technological similarities I pointed out in the other question are then justified if they are the same universe. You would pretty much expect <a href=""http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Nacelle"" rel=""nofollow"">warp nacelles</a> in any Federation ship if it is in the Star Treck universe, for example.</p>

<p>But the final evidence is that the above text is voiced by Mizuho's Seyuu, <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=542"" rel=""nofollow"">Inoue Kikuko</a>. Anime News Network has credits for her as <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13448"" rel=""nofollow"">""Misterious Voice (ep. 12)""</a>.</p>

<p>The production staff for both series is very similar and they share the same character designer.</p>

<p>So they probably are the same universe. Whether any of the characters is a descendant of Onegai ones, is better left to the realm of speculation. But it could explain why Ichika has memories of Mizuho's recording.</p>

<p>Either way we now know for sure that not everything is known about this ritual. Soi would say when he revived Natsume he did the same thing the omniyo agency did when they performed it. Which means he revived her as a familiar. But she doesn't have a master thus making her a rogue familiar and not a living spirit like it is explained. </p>

<p>Now before anyone says she is one and they say she is in the story let's remember a few things. Hokuto was a familiar. Hokuto was used to bind Natsume's spirit. Logically that would mean Natsume is now a familiar. </p>

<p>Following this vein of thought I have the belief that because she is a familiar without a master her spirit is unstable and will be until she A. dies B.gets a master or C. Harutora finds a way to separate hokuto from Natsume's without destroying the bond that is keeping her alive.</p>

<p>That is what I came up with to explain how the ritual could ""kinda work"" when Natsume is now alive but having trouble staying stable enough to live.</p>

<p>If you listen to the song carefully, it sounds like it's just a piano playing, and the tune is something similar to <code>C -&gt; A -&gt; B -&gt; G -&gt; A -&gt; F -&gt; G -&gt; E</code>, where it plays one note, then it skips a note and plays the next before going back up to the missed note, and the whole process is repeated.</p>

<p>Now, the song doesn't sound overly complex, so it may have been the reason why it is not included in the OST, regardless of how iconic it is or how many times it's played.</p>

<p>Another possible reason is that this tune has actually been used in some other work outside the anime beforehand. As a result, the production company may have been allowed to use only 15 seconds in the anime as background music, but is forbidden from putting it on soundtracks. My sketchy memory only recalls two other instances where this song is played: when Lelouch is around Nunnaly and when Kallen sees her mother on Refrain. I don't remember the song being any different in those cases, so its exclusion from the OST may have been a licensing issue (allow 15 seconds of the song to be used any number of times, but not allow the song to be reproduced in licensed soundtracks).</p>

<p>Most of the time, Katze talks with a high pitch, especially when bullying people. However, when Katze is not in control of the situation, his/her voice drops. This can be heard several times in the battle between O.D. and Katze that starts at 6:05 in the same episode. It's the same voice.</p>

"20679","1","","","2015-04-07 13:50:50","","6","2308","<p>I have noticed that traveling between and within the oceans in the One Piece world isn't easy. 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FGCI1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FGCI1.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>However, the Marines and some advanced pirate crews/alliances commute daily between the oceans. To be more specific, here are a few examples to demonstrate what I mean:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Marines travels between every oceans they want. By using Seastone on their ships, they can easily travel through the Calm Belt and switch between the Grand Line/New World and all Blues. Because the Marines is a member of the World Government, they can also pass the Red Line via Mary Joa.</p>

<p>However, the Seastone technique (Episode 410) is a new invention from Dr. Vegapunk. How did the Marines travel through the Calm Belt so easy before that? Another example in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiFOvnqltYw"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">episode 502-503</a>: How did a World Government ship travel from the Grand Line to East Blue 10 years ago when Seastone technique hadn't been invented?</p></li>
<li><p>In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhK3BRBsF34"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Luffy's past</a>, Shanks was in the East Blue, then in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD-4E3Zg_Qs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Battle of Marine Ford</a>, he was again in Grand Line, etc.</p>

<p>Same for Whitebeard. One time, Whitebead was in the Grand Line, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_v1KGYYf6Y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">then</a> in the East Blue, and then again in the Grand Line, etc.</p>

<p>How do Shanks and Whitebeard manage to travel between the Grand Line and the Blues on daily basis? <strong>Do Whitebead, Shanks and other Pirates also use Seastone like the Marines?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>And what about Monkey D. Dragon? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXfNIwcfa_M"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">One time</a>, Dragon was in the East Blue. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3ZCploiduQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a>, he was again in the Grand Line.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So I hope you see what my question is. I'm especially curious about the daily switching between the Grand Line/New World and Blues. As I know, the only way to enter the Grand Line is via the Reverse Mountain, which isn't the most harmless way as you can see in <a href=""http://onepiece-tube.com/folge/61"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">episode 61</a>. Does that mean that every time Whitebeard and Shanks want to go to the Grand Line, they have to pass this small river with their gigantic ships?</p>

<p>Apart from getting to the Grand Line, how do they leave the Grand Line/New World? According to the <a href=""http://www.opwiki.de/images/Karte_der_Grandline.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">maps</a>, there is no way to get out. How did <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Krieg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Krieg</a> leave the Grand Line?</p>

"24043","2","","23627","2015-08-13 07:37:58","","1","","<p>After mulling it over for a bit, the best answer I can come up with is that the tracks simply <strong>aren't musically complex enough</strong> compared to the other songs in the soundtrack, where musical complexity can be defined principally as variance in  <strong>theme</strong>.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed while listening to the soundtrack was that, despite the looping nature of background music in visual novels, each track was treated as its own song with a distinct beginning and end, with few exceptions. By listening to the version of the song on the soundtrack, you can usually hear endings that weren't included in the version that played in-game because otherwise the song wouldn't be able to loop smoothly and continuously. Some of the character themes (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUIdaCm5Ooo"" rel=""nofollow"">Haruka's</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENbgpg8tPy8"" rel=""nofollow"">Kud's</a>) lack resolutions and simply repeat and fade out after a while, but they still have varied structures that make them interesting to listen to. </p>

<p>For example, we do a quick and dirty analysis of Haruka's leitmotif (timestamps from the YouTube link):</p>

<ul>
<li>0:00 - Theme A </li>
<li>0:36 - Bridge A</li>
<li>0:53 - Theme B</li>
<li>1:30 - Theme C</li>
<li>1:47 - Theme A with added melody</li>
<li>2:23 - Bridge B</li>
<li>2:25 - Bridge A</li>
<li>2:43 - Theme B with varied percussion</li>
<li>3:01 - Theme C</li>
<li>3:19 - Theme A with same added melody</li>
<li>3:54 - Bridge B</li>
</ul>

<p>And from there the song repeats from the beginning. This song, like every other song on the <em>Official Soundtrack</em>, has a handful of different themes and melodies that makes it more than just a catchy jingle. On the other hand, the two tracks in question contain only one theme. Masato's song at least varies the melody on top of an eight-bar blues, but the track from Refrain is only a 27-second loop with one melody and two different chords. </p>

<p>The lack of musical depth reflects less effort put into the songs, which makes sense when you consider the context in which they are played. The songs on the <em>Original Soundtrack</em> will be heard dozens of times over the course of a playthrough, so having them become stale could ruin the gameplay experience. On the other hand, the two tracks excluded from the soundtrack will be played a handful of times at best in one playthrough, and they play during relatively short scenes. I imagine many other visual novels do the same thing - token jingles that play every so often are excluded from the official soundtrack because in the end, they're more of a sound effect than a song.</p>

<p>In general, when you have questions about what anime exist for a given franchise, a good approach is to search for one of the anime on <a href=""http://anidb.net"" rel=""nofollow"">AniDB</a> (e.g. <a href=""http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=6238"" rel=""nofollow"">AniDB's page for Eden of the East</a>), and look at the ""relation graph"" for that anime (<a href=""http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=rel&amp;aid=6238"" rel=""nofollow"">here's the one for Eden of the East</a>). This shows all anime that are related in some way or another to the anime you were looking at. The relation graphs get kind of messy for huge universes like Gundam (<a href=""http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=rel&amp;aid=715"" rel=""nofollow"">see graph</a>), but for most franchises, the relation graphs are quite useful.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first movie, Memories of Nobody: Ichigo is able to use his
bankai in the World of the Living, so it happens after the Bount Invasion arc and before the Arrancar one, as he's still unable to use his hollow form. So, it is between <strong>episode 109 &amp; 110</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The second movie, The Diamond Dust Rebellion: Ikkaku use his bankai,
so maybe it happens after the first invasion of Arrancars (the one
defeated by Toshiro team) and before they entering in Hueco mundo. In episodes, <strong>something near 138</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The third movie, Fade to black: I think it happens nearly to the
Diamond Dust Rebellion, during the Arrancar's fight, but before they
entering in Hueco Mundo, because Ichigo still use the first form of
his hollow mask: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pzq8E.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>The forth movie: The Hell Verse: In this movie Ichigo uses the second
form of his mask and transforms into his full hollow form, so he
already fought Ulquiorra in Hueco Mundo and returned. Repeating, its
like a filler, <strong>after episode 299</strong>.</p></li>

<p><strong>Quick Plot Summary / Overview:</strong> The scene opens with the Zeus' destruction above Synapse, Tomoki calls for Nymph to return immediately; unfortunately Ikaros responds that Nymph isn't coming. Tomoki commands Ikaros to take him straight to Synapse as the Earth's surface deliberately vanishes. While flying towards Synapse, Ikaros tells Tomoki a story how long ago due to malfunction she was once ordered by a ""boy"" to attack Synapse out of desperation. Remarking a dying Sugata, Ikaros' body begins burning away because of a device installed within her whenever she approaches Synapse without permission. Having second thoughts, Tomoki orders Ikaros to go back but cannot since there is nowhere else to go to.</p>

"23548","2","","23224","2015-07-25 05:29:07","","4","","<p>According to <a href=""http://gigazine.net/news/20150505-grisaia-machiasobi14/"" rel=""nofollow"">a Gigazine article</a> that reported on <a href=""http://www.machiasobi.com/events/grisaia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">a 2 May 2015 panel at Machi Asobi</a> featuring some of the Grisaia staff, it seems that Tensho (the director) just really wanted to do an anime fully in a cinematic aspect ratio (2.35:1 / 21:9 / Cinemascope) and refused to compromise on this point. Tensho does not appear to have elaborated on his motivations, at least not at this particular panel. So, chalk it up to directorial whim, I guess?</p>

<p>Incidentally, according to <a href=""https://twitter.com/tensho_tw/status/518818557488930816"" rel=""nofollow"">a tweet by Tensho</a>, Grisaia no Kajitsu was in fact the first television anime to be produced entirely in Cinemascope. Apparently, they had to place a special order for paper with that aspect ratio since they wanted to draw on paper that was genuinely the right size (rather than just taping over the top and bottom of standard 16:9 paper). </p>

<p>I should add: <a href=""http://anibin.blogspot.com/2014/10/1_99.html"" rel=""nofollow"">according to Anibin</a>, Grisaia no Kajitsu was actually produced at a native width of 1920 pixels (equivalent to 1080p video), so its ""true"" resolution is roughly 1920x822, not 1280x544. This is still something of a rarity (I think with the exception of Kyoto Animation?), though we're seeing more shows pop up in full 1080p nowadays, e.g. Working!!!, airing now (in summer 2015).  </p>

"34456","2","","195","2016-07-26 20:19:39","","0","","<p>I know I'm a bit late to the party but I'd like to give my take on this considering my understanding of the show is a bit less literal than the rest.</p>

<p>So throughout the two seasons we get to see the life story of Tomoya as well as other characters. The story is composed of many fun and happy moments but also some very sad and painful ones.</p>

<p>At the end of the show Tomoya goes through very rough times and just when he's about to break he is given a choice:</p>

<p>""Would you like to go back and redo everything from the moment you met Nagisa and not go through all that tough things as well as all of the happy moments or are you glad you got to live the life you were given despite everything?""</p>

<p>After that we get to see a much happier version of the world were everything went well and none of the bad things happened.</p>

<p>So basically to me Clannad can be summed up like this: Life can be very beautiful or very sad but either way don't ever let those terrible things stop you from living life at its fullest.</p>

<p>If we understand the show as an abstract metaphor designed to first reach your heart and then transmit that single very powerful message then every imperfection can be excused because everything in the plot is just an abstract illustration, only there to reach it's higher goal. And that goal is successfully attained when its all said and done.</p>

<p>Clannad touches your very soul and teaches you how to live life. That is its only objective and it's perfectly achieved. Ultimately anything concrete that happens in the show isn't important at all. That's why it's perfect and it's the best anime to have ever been created.</p>

"2786","2","","2504","2013-03-04 21:35:35","","4","","<p>It seems we're led to believe that the moths represent Watashi, the protagonist, in a metaphorical sense. Unfortunately, this is never officially explained.</p>

<p>With regard to <em>The Tatami Galaxy</em>, reviewers and analyzers seem to pull out the fact that moths are meant to symbolize humans. One reviewer<sup><a href=""http://guriguriblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/03/yojo-han-shinwa-taikei-letting-your-inner-moths-out-of-tatami-galaxy/"" rel=""nofollow"">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> called them pitiful (due to the fact that they are nocturnal, yet rely on light to survive). Another blogger<sup><a href=""http://animeotaku.animeblogger.net/2010/07/questions-and-answers-from-the-tatami-galaxy-yojo-han-shinwa-taikei/#comment-110721"" rel=""nofollow"">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> pointed out the <a href=""http://www.fauquiercounty.gov/images/departments/environmental/gmcycle.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">metamorphosis cycle of a moth</a>.</p>

<p>In both cases, these were drawn to parallels with human beings and, in particular, Watashi:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>People too can be pitiful sometimes. When life gets tough and one starts losing his rose-tinted visions of life, he blinds himself from the truth and begins to see what he only wants to see.</p></li>
  <li><p>After all, moths undergo complete metamorphosis. Something Watashi goes through.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This helps us somewhat to determine the origin of the moths. Every tatami mat room contained a moth (which usually frightened Atashi); upon Watashi's escape from Shimogamo Yuusuisou, the moths escape as well, linking them somewhat to Watashi and representing his escape.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[T]he protagonist's jailbreak out of his endlessly continuing cell of individual rooms is accompanied by a mysterious swarm of moths that overwhelm the city of Kyoto. Officially unexplained, this massive swarm of moths is the simultaneous outpouring of Individual moths from the infinite number of 4.5 tatami mat rooms, each of which contained a single moth.<sup><a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3arceOMD_1hNkJ%3awww.academia.edu/2093366/_Condensing_the_Media_Mix_Tatami_Galaxys_Multiple_Possible_Worlds_in_Canadian_Journal_of_Film_Studies_21_2_Fall_2012_+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk"" rel=""nofollow"">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did the moths help Ozu? Hard to say for sure; again, officially unexplained. One viewer I mentioned<sup><a href=""http://animeotaku.animeblogger.net/2010/07/questions-and-answers-from-the-tatami-galaxy-yojo-han-shinwa-taikei/#comment-110721"" rel=""nofollow"">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> suggested them as a spirit animal, though:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then at the end, the moths come down in force as a benevolent instrument to make him possibly the only thing that could stand out more than Ozu. Why are the moths benevolent, and is there some reason why they are chosen? Is it because moths, like him undergo a complete metamorphosis and as such are sort of like his spirit animal?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that in general, <em>The Tatami Galaxy</em> likes to leave some things for the viewer to consider upon finishing the series. There likely is not one single, genuine answer to the question you've posed, but the symbolism of the moth seems to be a good explanation for how and why they appear in the swarm.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fuso is Japan, since all the Fuso characters have Japanese names. I don't know where they get the name ""Fuso"", though.</li>
<li>Orussia is Russia.</li>
<li>Gallia is France. The characters have French names, and the word ""Gallia"" comes from a Roman province which included modern-day France.</li>
<li>Hispania is Spain. The name comes from the Roman name for the Iberian peninsula, which includes modern-day Spain and Portgual.</li>
<li>Romagna is Italy. The word comes from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romagna"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a Latin term for ""land inhabited by Romans""</a> and refers to a modern-day region in Northern Italy.</li>
<li>Britannia is England. ""Britannia"" was the Roman term for the region of the British Isles inhabited by the Britons, and was later used to refer to the nation of Great Britain. This usage was also seen in Code Geass. The characters all have English names.</li>
<li>Liberion is the United States. The character Charlotte Yeager is a pretty clear reference to American pilot Chuck Yeager, one of the first pilots to fly faster than sound. The <a href=""http://strikewitches.wikia.com/wiki/Liberion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Strike Witches wiki</a> also claims that Liberion is an analogue for the US.</li>
<li>Suomus is Finland. The characters' names are all Finnish. The word ""Suomus"" seems to come from ""Suomi"", which is the Finnish language's own word for itself.</li>
<li>Karlsland is Germany. Specifically it seems to represent the German Empire as it existed before the First World War.</li>
</ul>

<p>The wiki also has a map of the Strike Witches world that shows several other countries, almost all analogous to real world countries. In general it looks very similar to our world around the time World War I broke out.</p>

"17054","2","","17053","2014-12-25 02:15:30","","5","","<p>I've watched the original (now pulled) and the edited version (currently on CrunchyRoll). The only change I noticed was with regards to the dialogue in the play which Shizuka attends, about 11 minutes into the episode. The original dialogue was clearly taken from Samuel Beckett's famous play <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Waiting for Godot</em></a>. This play is still copyrighted. To make things worse, as is described in the Wikipedia article linked, Beckett was strongly opposed to having female actors cast in the play, which the episode has. While the amount of the original it used was quite small (there's only about 15 seconds of dialogue), Japanese copyright law has no <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use"" rel=""nofollow"">fair use policy</a>, and so this could still be an issue.</p>

<p>The modified version only changed the dialogue during the play. Rather than taking lines from the original, the new dialogue is a noticeable reference to <em>Waiting for Godot</em>, but not taken directly from the play. The animation did not seem to have been modified, so the characters' lips didn't exactly match the new dialogue; this will likely be fixed in the final DVD version.</p>

<p>The references to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Runaway_Ideon"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Space Runaway Ideon</em></a> seem to be unchanged. Both the original and new version called it ""Ide<em>p</em>on"". While many initially suspected that these were the source of trouble, the <em>Godot</em> references seem to have been the bigger problem.</p>

<p>As for the reason, from the posts I have seen on the Internet, there seems to be no official reason given for the cancellation of the anime series. (Usually, the official reason will be cited before people give their own interpretation or speculation of the situation, but I don't see any).</p>

<p><a href=""http://edas88.hubpages.com/hub/Will-Bleach-Return-and-When"" rel=""nofollow"">This page by edas88</a> gives 2 theory as for why the series was cancelled:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The anime was sub-par and had too many fillers</strong><sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>I don't know if <a href=""http://www.geocities.jp/animesityouritu/"" rel=""nofollow"">this source</a> for TV anime series viewership rating is reliable or not, but viewership for Bleach started out at around 5%, gradually dropped but still managed to get 2-3% up to the point of Aizen's defeat, but it reduced further and sustained at 1-2% till the point it was cancelled.</p>

<p>Compared to the other two series in the <em>Big 3</em>, One Piece sustained at around 10% viewership over the same period, and Naruto at 7-9% at the beginning, but still got 3-5% at the point Bleach anime was cancelled.</p>

<p><sup><sup>1</sup> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_%28anime%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> says that 111 of all 366 episodes are fillers.</sup></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The anime stopped to wait for more material from the manga, instead of continuing with filler episodes as what they had been doing.</strong></p>

<p>On this side, at the time of writing, there are <a href=""http://www.idigitaltimes.com/bleach-anime-returns-expect-2015-release-once-manga-finishes-376751"" rel=""nofollow"">some speculations</a> that the anime will restart production in 2015, since the manga is expected to end in 2015.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>At the time of writing (May 27th, 2015), the manga has not ended its serialization yet. According to <a href=""https://www.mangaupdates.com/releases.html?search=35&amp;stype=series"" rel=""nofollow"">mangaupdates</a>, chapter 627 was released on May 21st, 2015 by scanlation groups.

<p>Considering that Yoshika's and Mio's trip to Britannia took only 2 months (taking the southern route of Yokosuka-Macau-Malacca-India-Egypt-Cape-Town-Pas de Calais-Dover), It's possible that BW happened during August as the news of Mio's arrival just reached them and after the approval of Hikari being sent to Orrusia, she has to train more in their school and she was took to Orussia the same time that the Shokaku was on a voyage to Novo-Khmolgory.

"22206","2","","13453","2015-06-06 23:42:54","","2","","<p>I began this as a comment on Toshinou Kyouko's answer, and it's sort of a supplement to that answer.</p>

<p>US companies, in general, have become a lot more averse to producing dubs. In the days of Geneon (2003&ndash;2007), almost everything that came out had a dub. That is no longer the case; lots of shows come out with no dub, and it seems that, as Toshinou-san mentioned, any show that isn't going to make the sales doesn't get one. Shoujo anime typically doesn't sell that well in the US; only a small fraction of all the shoujo produced even comes out here. (Shoujo manga used to sell well, in the age of Geneon, which was also the age of Tokyopop.)</p>

<p>Why don't companies want to produce dubs? The economics of anime has changed pretty drastically. In the Geneon days, you bought anime as a series of DVD releases, usually six or seven of them, for about $30 each. That works out to about $180 to own a complete series, but the companies also sold a lot of individual copies of the first few discs. (If you think that's bad, the original release of Eva was on 13 VHS tapes, each with two episodes, and you had to pick whether to buy the dub tapes or the sub tapes.) </p>

<p>Legal streaming sites changed that. Whether you intend to buy the DVDs or not, it makes sense to watch it for free online so you know you're getting a good value. Everyone stopped paying $60 just to watch the first five or six episodes of a series to find out if it was good or not. DVD releases now are usually in box sets that contain 13 episodes. The US distributors have to assume that everyone who buys the DVDs has already seen the series online, which drastically limits the market for most shows. Also, US distributors today have seen Geneon and ADV fold because they spent too much money on fancy dub scripts and pop-up notes for shows that turned out to be unpopular. For shows like, well, about 80% of what I watch, producing a dub is a losing proposition.</p>

<p>I also believe dubs became less popular because the TV market for anime dried up. In the mid-2000s, TV networks were hooking up left and right with anime distributors. Cartoon Network was working with Viz and Funimation; Encore was carrying titles for ADV and Media Blasters; Geneon worked with TechTV (later G4) and even had a deal with MTV that resulted in a disastrous run of Heat Guy J. As far as I can tell, no one except Cartoon Network is carrying anime anymore, and they've scaled back quite a bit. The networks have also been hit by the Internet, and they've figured out that they can produce their own anime-like content, such as Avatar: The Last Airbender, and have full control over it, instead of having to work out some weird limited-term licensing deal with a US distributor who already has a weird limited-term licensing deal with a Japanese distributor.</p>

<p>Producing a dub is much more expensive than producing a subtitled translation; that's why you see lots of fansubs, but very few fandubs. That's also why streaming sites such as Crunchyroll don't produce their own dubs. And since anime is still fairly low-profile in the US, for a lot of shows, it just doesn't make sense to spend that money.</p>

"362","2","","340","2012-12-13 20:10:07","","16","","<p>Seeing as you see a image of Spike before this final line is displayed, I think there's little doubt that this quote is entirely directed at Spike. What meaning it holds for Spike, might be open to debate, but here's one take on it:</p>

<p>It makes sense to me that the quote references the weight that Spike carried around with him after leaving the syndicate. Throughout the series, Spike seems like a pretty easy-going guy (""whatever happens, happens""), except for when the life he left behind catches up with him.</p>

<p>Whenever something or someone from his past crosses his life, you'll notice that he starts acting differently (i.e. how he reacts when he hears Julia's name at the beginning of ""Jupiter Jazz""). I think it's implied that he's been carrying a lot of emotional baggage around from his earlier days, since he always talks about not knowing whether he is really alive or dead.</p>

<p>Although it can be said that he's referring to his his near-death experience, I think he's also referring to the fact that he hasn't really felt alive since he left the syndicate. </p>

<p>The ""weight"" described might be all the inner turmoil he's carried and never had a chance to deal with dealt with throughout the run of the show. Perhaps this quote is a reflection on the quintessential parts of Spike was never explorer over the course of the entire series?</p>

<p>Also I can't help but think that the title and lyrics of the Beetle's song ""Carry That Weight"" carries a deeper meaning that parallels the show. If you're a fan of the band you've probably heard about these two interpretations. According to the <a href=""http://beatles.wikia.com/wiki/Carry_That_Weight"">Beatles Wiki</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One interpretation is that the title (and main lyric) is a reference to two people, John Lennon and Paul McCartney. In McCartney's view, if Lennon allowed the Beatles to break up, he would be ""carrying the weight"" for that for the rest of his life. McCartney essentially blames Lennon and Yoko Ono for the decline in the band's relationship. The second reference, to McCartney himself, is about ""carrying the weight"" of the band by acting as the manager after the death of Brian Epstein. Until he took on the job, McCartney had never realized how much Epstein did for them, nor how difficult it was to manage the financial side of the Beatles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Supposedly, after the song's interlude, ""Paul, you're going to carry that weight"" can be heard in the chorus.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In this sense you could could see Spike as John Lennon, and his decision to go to the syndicate as Lennon's decision to allow The Beatles to break up. Even though Ed and Ein (which combined, is some respects, represents Ringo) had already left at that point, the Bebop still had its three main characters together and could have continued living together without things changing (just missing a drummer). As Spike is leaving, Faye (in McCartney's role) vainly tries to threaten/persuade Spike into staying. She knows his departure will mean the end of the Bebop as they know it, implying that Spike deciding to leave would make him responsible for the dissolution. Then both of them die before they can reunite with their (respective) group, at the hands of their so-called ""friends"" (Vicious, as a former ally of Spike, and Chapman, as a schizophrenic fan). Therefore, Spike, because he chose to leave the ship and face certain death, and bear the ""blame"" for the ending of the name of the Bebop (to the characters of the show), while also providing the literal ending to the series.</p>

They could have picked a fight and might have won this round, but if they had, the guild would have been completely destroyed shortly after by Twilight Ogre. Master Macao, The Fourth, did not want to risk this as they didn't have much job opportunities as it is, let alone if they had to pay for hospital expenses and repair expenses additionally. Also Fairy Tail was indebted to Twilight Ogre and it is not really in the guild's policy to steal money and to repay your debts. That's why the Fourth accepted their faith and punishment and by doing so he kept their losses at a minimum, while keeping the guild alive as long as possible.</p>

Do you also remember how they talked about the orbs of glowing light being a representation of happiness and can grant wishes?</p>

<p>Well, the ending basically brings those two concepts together. The other universe has the robot and the girl: the robot is Tomoya and the girl is Ushio. They are on the side where all the orbs of happiness come from the world that people live in.</p>

<p>At the end, after Ushio died and Tomoya collapsed into the snow, they show the beginning of the series again with Nagisa sitting under the tree and Tomoya saying to himself that he wished he'd never met her, because he regretted all the things they had gone through, and because she would still be alive otherwise. While he was fighting with his regrets, Nagisa started to leave and walked up the hill. Seeing Nagisa leaving, Tomoya chased after her and hugged her, where she responded with something like ""What took you so long?"". This is where he decided that he should have never regretted meeting her, as he realized that he loved the time he spent with her because he loved her so much. At that moment, the orbs of happiness essentially granted his wish and put him back into his normal universe with the alternate ending.</p>

<p>The manga has a different, more revealing ending compared to the anime which just concluded. The ending in the manga also fuses more completely with the sequel, <em>Tokyo Ghoul:re</em>, which began serialization late 2014. The best thing to do would be to go back and read the last portion of the manga to get a different, more conclusive ending.</p>

<h3>Pertaining to Tokyo Ghoul:re</h3>

<p>Basically, as far as the manga is concerned, Kaneki:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ... is now an amnesiac of sorts and is now known as Haise Sasaki, a Rank 1 investigator and the leader of a special unit of investigators at the Commission of Counter Ghoul(CCG). All the members of that unit underwent similar surgeries as him, allowing them to obtain the special abilities of ghouls in order to fight them, but still being able to live as normal humans.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> It seems that a lot of people want to simply write this off as speculation, with no proof that Haise Sasaki is indeed Ken Kaneki's new identity in the sequel who survived the conclusive battle with Arima and is now serving as a mentor at CCG under Akira Mado 2 years later.<br>
<br>
 Below are some brief hints from chapter 8 volume 1 (which has Sasaki on the cover) of <em>Tokyo Ghoul:re</em> without revealing too much. I find these to be a bit more than mere 'speculation'.<br>
<br>
 <em>Haise Sasaki begins to notice past self:</em><br>
<br>
 <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/Y0JY2p7.png"" alt=""""><br>
<br>
 <em>Note the mention of a 2 year time span and an amnesia like state questioning about a past life of friends and family, as well as paternalistic Arima:</em><br>
<br>
 <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/F0yLNpG.png"" alt=""""></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In summary, to answer your question,</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ... they did fight, and Kaneki did lose. While he did not die, the aftermath of the fight resulted in him having an amnesia and developing a new identity in a new exciting plot for the sequel, <strong>Tokyo Ghoul:re</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's impossible to tell what they would do in the animated adaptation until its release, although I'm sure it will follow along the same line of plot.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The current season of the anime may be nearing its end, but reports suggest that a <strong>new project is in the works</strong>, with the publisher of the manga, Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine, slated to officially <strong>reveal the rumored project</strong> in its 17th issue of the year on March 23.
  <a href=""http://www.hngn.com/articles/190587/20160319/fairy-tail-anime-reportedly-new-project-store-fans.htm"">http://www.hngn.com/articles/190587/20160319/fairy-tail-anime-reportedly-new-project-store-fans.htm</a></p>
  
  <p>Kodansha did not hint at what the new project will be, but <strong>this is not the end for the Fairy Tail anime.</strong>  This is most likely a hiatus, similar to the one that was taken in 2013.
  <a href=""http://goboiano.com/news/4176-the-current-fairy-tail-anime-is-ending-on-march-26"">http://goboiano.com/news/4176-the-current-fairy-tail-anime-is-ending-on-march-26</a></p>
  
  <p>They stopped airing the anime in the year 2013 and came back in the year 2014. So majority of fans expect this Hiatus <strong>to be a year long.</strong>

<p>One of the reasons that may have caused it is the fact that the anime is close to the manga and in order to avoid changing the story( see Full Metal Achemist 2003 and Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood)  they've chose to let the manga go ahead in order to have the original source material.</p>

In the first episode,</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> When Hisashi is bitten by one of 'them', he has a wound for a long time. It takes more than 2 hours for him to finally die.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the first 9 minutes of episode 3 or 4, there are annotations on the bottom of the screen stating the time of the events that occurred. When we see the scene with Takashi, Hisashi and Rei are running through the school trying to make it through to the roof - you can easily see</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> the wound on Hisashi's arm - which is a bite mark that made him infected, and death inescapable. He coughs and splutters blood, and it takes him from around 1:00 PM to 3:05PM to die.</p>

<p>However, later in the series, you can see that those bitten can also become 'them' instantaneously. For instance,</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">

Since Harutora has now full control of the raven cape and also knows that Kon has transformed into Hishamaru, and when she did transform into her, Harutora knew her name. This shows that he regained his memories of being Yakou.</p>

<p>As Yakou was a genius omnyoji and visionary, he was able to create the ritual of Taizan Fukun. He was able to reincarnate himself into Harutora, this is proven in the premise of the first paragraph. We can then conclude that when Harutora was in the white room with Natsume and he said ""I hope to see you again"", in addition to Suzu Saotome's response of the ritual being ""technically successful"", we can infer that Natsume will be reincarnated. Since Harutora's memories of Yakou developed so have his skills and memories of his own Taizan Fukun ritual. Yakou is the only person capable of performing this ritual, and it succeeds. The last season of episode 24 was Harutora and his shikigami's walking away from the ritual after it has succeeded. Harutora will meet Natsume again, her reincarnation that is.</p>

<p><em>Just a theory</em>. I really enjoyed this series and I hope to see a second season, with proof of my assumption.</p>

<p>However, it is worth nothing that the reason behind this hiatus is the mangaka's <strong>illness</strong>. Togashi has been experiencing serious back problems 
(sources: <a href=""http://www.fandompost.com/2014/09/05/yoshihiro-togashi-extends-hunter-x-hunter-manga-hiatus/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FANDOM</a>, <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-09-04/hunter-hunter-manga-hiatus-continues-until-further-notice/.78384"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ANN-1</a>, <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-08-28/hunter-x-hunter-manga-extends-hiatus-at-least-1-more-week/.78119"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ANN-2</a>)
which have caused him numerous <em>short</em> breaks over the years. This illness (along with chest pains and sleep loss) has been with him for a quite a while and may have started back when he was still doing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YuYu_Hakusho"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yuyu Hakusho</a></p>

<p>These back problems, particularly in the lower back area - makes it hard for a mangaka to deliver weekly chapters. When this condition worsened this year, he was forced to take a hiatus. The <strong>anime</strong> will not progress with the mangaka's storyline nor will it be filled with <em>fillers</em> because Togashi would not allow it (and frankly, it would be a waste). It is also <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/2hdxi8/why_cant_yoshihiro_togashi_dictate_what_happens/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rumored</a> that Togashi could just ask an assistant/s to draw Hunter X Hunter with his storyline but chooses not to for various reasons. </p>

<li>Katsura, Gintoki, and Takasugi are brought as prisoners and Gintoki is given choice to kill either students or teacher, on a top of mountain.

<p>They pretty much admit to this using Gintoki to explain at the end of episode 306, where they include another Ginpachi-Sensei segment.  They even use the point you mention that previously it looked as if Gin joined Shuoyou's school after Katsura and Takasugi, when in the latest episodes it appears to be the reverse.  They make a joke about it not having a script at the time and that something entirely different is happening.  </p>

<p>This is probably as close to an offcial answer that we'll get.</p>

<p>There may be other mentions to why the other points you make out have changed in-between episodes but no mention of this (even as a joke) has appeared in the manga as far as I remember.</p>

<p>At one point Funimation's ""Case Closed"" website had a FAQ page with this question asked. An archival copy of this page can be found <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20040327142351/http://caseclosed.com/"">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why did you change the name to Case Closed?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Due to legal considerations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We see the same vague response in a 2004 <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2004-02-05/funimation-renames-conan"">news article</a> published by Anime News Network:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FUNimation sent out an advisory today stating that due to unspecified legal considerations, Detective Conan is to be renamed ""Case Closed"" . . . Due to legal considerations, this highly anticipated series will be released in the United States as Case Closed. Working closely with our Japanese partners, Case Closed was chosen as the name best suited for the U.S. market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it seems to be mostly speculation, there have been <a href=""http://msgboard.snopes.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=107;t=000637;p=1"">forum posts</a> mentioning that this renaming is due to the copyright held by DC Comics on the name Conan. I'm not convinced by that reasoning, but I included it for you to digest as you please.</p>

During some of the frames of the video, there are crab tins with the word ""Cancer"" on them, but neither cancer nor Steve Jobs are mentioned in the song.

<p>The original, titled <strong>Full Metal Panic!</strong> is the first manga of the series, by Retsu Tateo. This covers the first season of the anime. It follows it pretty closely with the anime, but there are some subtle differences. The series ends after the Tuatha de Danaan hijacking is resolved. </p>

<p><strong>Overload</strong> does not follow any of the anime at all and was published as a type of side story that is not related to the anime or the light novels. <strong>Surplus</strong> is basically the (1 volume) sequel to Overload. None of this is canon, it's essentially an officially-published doujinshi.</p>

<p><strong>Comic Mission</strong> is more of a light-hearted side story (by the same artist as the original), like <em>Fumoffu</em>, that deviates from the main mecha story. Each chapters is more or less a self contained short story. Certain stories like ""Cinderella Panic"" are from the light novel's side stories while other are original scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Sigma</strong> is a continuation of the anime, but illustrated by a different artist (Ueda Hiroshi). It begins around the same time as <em>The Second Raid</em> (Volume 4: <em>Ending Day By Day</em>). This manga parallels the light novels and picks up where TSR left off and deals with the events after it. This series is meant to be a continuation of the original manga. </p>

<p><strong>Another</strong> is another story in the <em>Full Metal Panic</em> universe, set 11 years after the events in the original FMP series with Sosuke and Kaname, with a new protagonist, new heroine. Lina (short for: Adelina Aleksandrovna Kerenskaya) is an AS pilot for the PMC, known as DOMS (Dana O'Shee Military Service), which seems to be have been created by Tessa and run by Mao. The male protagonist, who looks like Sousuke, is Tatsuya Ichinose, he is the son of a Power Slave (PS) mechanic. PSes are AS made for civilian use, like construction.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2012/11/10/a-look-at-rideback-authors-take-on-full-metal-panic-manga"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Zero</strong> series</a>, scheduled to be released January of 2013, is a retelling of the light novel by Tetsuro Kasahara, the author of Rideback.  This series starts, like the light novel and anime, just before Sousuke gets the mission to guard Kaname. The only thing new (so far) about this series is the art. </p>

<p>For an example, in episode 17 of the <em>Railgun</em> anime, Komoe-sensei mentions how she likes all her students, even the ones that blow up her roof, which is probably a reference to when Index used Dragon's Breath (episode 6 of <em>Index</em>). </p>

<p>The manga gives a better frame of reference, since it gives a exact date (July 16th). 
So the events in <em>Railgun</em> begin 4 days before the Index novel (July 20th), where Touma first meets Index. Touma <a href=""http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index%3aVolume1_Prologue"">meets</a> Mikoto on the eve of July 19th. </p>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun?from=Manga.ToAruKagakuNoRailgun"">TV Tropes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The anime, however, violates this by adapting events from Volume 8 of the novels into the anime's first episode. As it stands, Chapters 18 to 39 occur around the time of Volume 3 in the novels, Chapter 40 is around volume 5, Chapters 41-42 and around volume 8 and Chapters 43-current take place around volume 9.</p>

<p>So today on ""Source Fed nerd - Anime Club"" they reviewed the anime and one of the hosts (Meg Turney) said something about that Eden of the East had different series.</p>

<p>I've watched:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eden of the East (11 episodes)(Higashi no Eden)</li>
<li>Eden of the East the Movie I: The King of Eden (Higashi no Eden Gekijoban I: The King of Eden)</li>

<ol>
<li>Shouyou found Gintoki in a battlefield.</li>
<li>Shouyou created a school with Gintoki.</li>
<li>Katsura and Takasugi joined the school.</li>
<li>Shouyou and Gintoki entered the class with Shouyou giving Gintoki a book to wipe his ass like shown in the Ginpachi-sensei section of episode 306.</li>
<li>Shouyou's school was labeled as teaching children to overthrow the Bakufu.</li>
<li>As shown in episode 306 flashback, Shouyou stopped some patrol from drawing their swords against Sakata Gintoki, Takasugi Shinsuke and Katsura Koutaro.</li>
<li>Shouyou got arrested but was later released, probably with strict warning that this is his last chance and he must stop teaching. This is where Gintoki is shown crying upon his return.</li>
<li>Shouyou ignored the warning and continued to teach as shown in the flashback where Gintoki said that the Bushidou Shouyou taught and they follows won't be bend by such a thing (the threat).</li>
<li>Shouyou teach again for some years and was then arrested again. This fits with he fact that when Gintoki and friends fought in the war, they are older than when they are in school.</li>
<li>Gintoki and other Shouyou students formed a rebel group to save Shouyou.</li>
<li>The Dragon of Katsurahama, Sakamoto Tatsuma joined the group and act as the fund raiser.</li>
<li>As shown in the flashback where Sakamoto and Gintoki crash landed in a desert planet (it was in the first or second season of the anime, I forget which episode), Sakamoto said that he thinks that fighting is not the only way to protect things he deemed precious. He left the group and formed a trade company.</li>
<li>Sakata Gintoki, Katsura Koutaro and Takasugi Shinsuke got arrested and brought to a hill where Yoshida Shouyou is.</li>
<li>Gintoki chose to kill Yoshida Shouyou, his teacher, to save Takasugi and Katsura. His head was indeed returned to Gintoki. The setting might differs but the essence of the story is the same.</li>
</ol>

<p>As for Takasugi losing his eyes to Oboro, it indeed differs from what shown before. Most likely it is because of both Sunrise and Gorilla-sensei didn't think about it when the scene was made. Which is also confirmed by Gintoki in the Ginpachi-sensei section of episode 306.</p>

Shortly after the anime, Hal Film Maker merged into the parent company TYO Animations. There may have been some issues with licensing works from a company that didn't exist anymore.</p>

<p>This was also around the time of legal online streaming's emergence - so interested studios (possibly Funimation, who took on B Gata H Kei - Hal Studio's next production) had a lot of business decisions and work at this time.</p>

<p>Most dubbed anime go under a lot of cost analysis to see whether it is worth it to produce. Usually shounen works are the easiest of works to pull a profit on. Shoujo works are harder to sell, so perhaps it was decided by most companies that it just wasn't worth it.</p>

<p>Any of these could be potential reasons and this probably isn't a very satisfying answer, but unless there's an official announcement by a involved company, we won't know due to company secrecies.</p>

<p>The longer it remains unlicensed however, the less likely it is to be picked up as it slowly looses the target audience's interest.</p>

Searching for ""Limit Break OP ED"" reveals that it's the name of the third OP of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardfight!!_Vanguard"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Cardfight!! Vanguard</strong></a>. We can further confirm by comparing the blurry words in the middle of the image with the official stylized logo of <em>Cardfight!! Vanguard</em>:</p>

<p><sup>Take note of the similarity of the word Vanguard in red</sup></p>

<p>It would be great to have the original video for comparison, though tracking down the actual advertisement for comparison is quite hard at this point.</p>

<p>As for why an irrelevant advertisement gets in the middle of a <em>Little Busters</em> episode, I'm rather sure it only appears in the release by a fansub group. In the original Japanese broadcast, it's typical to have a few advertisement in the middle of the show, and whoever in charge of encoding the video failed to trim off this frame from the original transport stream.</p>

<p>The manga has 9 volumes and one extra volume (titled 'Bonus track').</p>

<p>The <em>""I'm happy Sen is gone""</em> scene with Kaoru failing to convey his feelings to Ritsuko and afterwards telling her that he'll be going to Tokyo is the end of the manga's 8th volume. This scene is at 6 minutes into the anime's last episode. </p>

<p>In short, the following content of manga volumes 9 and Bonus is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kaoru leaves to study medicine at a Tokyo university where he rekindles his love with jazz. He kind of makes up with Ritsuko, then finds out she seems to be with another man and cuts all ties. He becomes a doctor at a Kyushu hospital and through a hint by Yurika (who lives with Junichi and later has twins) finds out that Sen became a priest on a nearby island. Sen arrived there after initially having decided to leave everything behind after his sister's accident. Only after realizing how much he loves to work with children does he change his mind. Kaoru meets Ritsuko again many years later, learning she never was in a serious relationship. The manga ends with everyone meeting for a jam session on the island, listened to by Ritsuko who is pregnant with Kaoru's child.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's a more detailed breakdown by chapters. For the sake of brevity Ritsuko is R. and Kaoru is K.</p>

<p>Volume 9:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ch41</strong>: On graduation day R. ignores K. He keeps thinking about Sen, but tells people that all this will soon be behind him and he will focus on his studies in Tokyo. K. shouts his apology at R.'s window, same as in the anime. The following train scene is slightly less dramatic - they have time to exchange a few words. R.'s dad thinks that Sen might have gone to Tokyo, too.</li>
<li><strong>ch42</strong>:  K. is at university in Tokyo. With the student strikes still underway life seems easy going. He meets a girl at a party who invites herself over to his place for the night, but thinking of R. he sends her away again without anything happening. While visiting his mother, she sings <em>Lullaby of Birdland</em> waking old memories in him.</li>
<li><strong>ch43</strong>: The strikes end and instead of partying, K. starts playing piano again after joining the jazz club at university and taking on a part-time job in a Shinjuku bar. The stress of both the job and upcoming university exams has K. at a low when he finds a photo of him and Sen in the bag R. gave him on his departure. The note on the back reads <em>To the two idiots. Friendship is for life. Since 1966, and forever</em>.  Inspired by this K. changes his mind and begins asking around at work for Sen. He also finally answers a letter he received from R. in ch42. </li>
<li><strong>ch44</strong>: Junichi shows up at K.'s work and promises to help looking out for Sen as well. K. quits his job in favour of his studies but keeps exchanging letters with R. Over time, her's become less frequent and shorter. One day a telephone number is on a postcard from R. Upon calling the number K. is greeted by a man telling him to leave R. alone. K. assumes the obvious. At his grandfather's funeral K. is told the he is expected to inherit the formers hospital and become 'the pillar of the Nishimi family' (implying upcoming marriage interviews). K. sees Seji, who is now a celebrity, in the TV and realizes that unlike Seiji, he hasn't been following his dreams. Shortly after K. looses the photo of him and Sen and fails to find it again. Yurika (Junichi's girlfriend) visits K. in the hospital and gives him the photo of Sen as a priest together with the address on the island.</li>
<li><strong>ch45</strong>: We see Sen as a priest in training on the aforementioned island. He seems popular with the kids and islanders. The sound of Moanin' being played on the organ draws him back to the church where he meets K. and they promptly have to run away from the head priest angry at the unauthorized organ usage. After a jump in time we learn that K. turned down the inheritance of the hospital and instead joined a hospital in Kyushu. At Sachiko's wedding (in Sen's church), K. meets R. again and learns that she never really was and certainly isn't in a relationship with the guy on the phone anymore. R. learns that K. isn't going back to Tokyo.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus Track (Volume 10):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Track 1</strong>: Yurika is living with Junichi and is having trouble finding a job because she didn't graduate high-school. By chance, she finally finds one in painting sign-boards. While she is increasingly occupied with work, Junichi seems to act  cold and shows that he does not seem to think of a future for him and Yurika. It takes another train station scene with Yurika on the verge of moving out and out of the city for Junichi to admit his feelings.</li>
<li><strong>Track 2</strong>: Kouta (one of Sen's brothers), now 14, is shown picking up jazz drumming in the record store's basement. He spends some time with R. who is over around the time of New Year's and they meet the guy who answered the phone when K. called R. back then. He doesn't take No for an answer which leads to an intervention of Kouta, and R. openly admitting to both of them that she still loves K.</li>
<li><strong>Track 3</strong>: Backstory of Tsutomu (R.'s dad). He was introduced to Jazz by a guy called Kenji. Kenji often played Jazz with his brother and Tsutomu used to stop to listen to the sound he heard from the street, until Kenji invites him in one day and starts teaching him bass cello. There he also meets Fumi who has an unnamed illness and sneaks away from the hospital to spend time at Kenji's. With the second world war intensifying, Kenji goes off to join the naval band and Tsutomu is drafted for factory work. Kenji dies in the war and Tsutomu spends some hours with Fumi (who is still in the hospital) after not having seen her for a long time. During the following air raid Tsutomu saves Fumi's life but afterwards finds himself devastated by the destruction. To cheer him up she drags the cello to him and he plays solemn notes to gathering survivors amidst the rubble. Opening the record shop is fulfilling the dream Kenji had ('to spread the music of the world to this town and gather musicians to play together every day').</li>
<li><strong>Track 4</strong>: Explains what happened to Sen after his sister's accident. Sen is found, almost drowned, by a fisherman. While staying at the latter's place to earn money for traveling on, Sen becomes friends with a younger reclusive orphan. Playing on improvised drums with her and the other kids in the village Sen remembers how much fun he has a around children and decides on his future career. it is initially suggested Sen might have tried to commit suicide by throwing himself into the sea. However, when he leaves the town we learn that he jumped into the water while trying to retrieve the orphan's necklace and passed out in the process.</li>
<li><strong>Track 5</strong>: Kaoru, Sen and Junichi all meet up for a Jazz session on the island and learn that Yurika had twins. Sen sees Junichi for the first time since their argument years ago, but seemingly overcame all bad feelings and congratulates the two. Shortly after, Tsutomu and the pregnant Ritsuko arrive as well. The guys start arguing about the instrument the child will pick up, everyone of course vouching for their own, until Ritsuko reconciles the discussions with her suggestions of the saxophone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reasons</h2>

<p>Concerning chirale's comment, I did not find anything specifically mentioning whether the series was originally planned to be longer. However, be aware that the Bonus Track Manga was <a href=""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-30/sakamichi-no-apollon-manga-gets-spinoff-series-in-march"">announced only in January 2012</a>, while the anime <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13944"">started airing already in April 2012</a>. It is very possible of course, that the people involved were talking to eachother, but depending on how fleshed out the story for the additional Manga was (not) at this time, there probably wasn't enough time to fit it into the Anime as well.</p>

<p>In addition, as can be seen above, there isn't really enough story missing to warrant a second cour and some of the stories from the Bonus Track are rather episodic in nature, and therefore hard to adapt into a coherent episode.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BfYlk.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BfYlk.jpg"" alt=""Death Parade screencap""></a></p>

<p><em>Death Parade</em> is an anime that's about a place after death, where you are either sent to nowhere (hell) or you are going to be reincarnated (heaven). So I was wondering if there was a deeper meaning in showing this person, because after Light's death, it isn't impossible that he is going to be judged in this world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a Devil Fruit user dies, their ability is reborn into another fruit of the same kind. Instead of growing from a plant, the ability simply regenerates inside the closest appropriate fruit, as seen when Smiley ""died"" and the <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Sara_Sara_no_Mi,_Model%3a_Axolotl"">Sara Sara no Mi, Model: Axolotl</a> transplanted itself into a nearby apple. Another characteristic of a Devil Fruit's growth is that the stem becomes noticably curlier than it was when the fruit was not endowed with the ability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in other words, the Devil Fruit ""respawns"" when the user that had it dies.</p>

"18545","2","","18537","2015-01-15 16:25:48","","12","","<p>Okay, so a bit of a Japanese lesson:<br>
<i>'B-gata'</i> would normally refer to the blood type. The Japanese are pretty fond of associating blood types with certain personality traits; and a B-type person is considered to be a bit impulsive, passionate, but their actions 'don't come across clearly' to others. (That seems to describe Yamada's character rather well, doesn't it?)<br>
On the other hand, <i>'H-kei'</i> normally has to do with 'ecchi' (the Japanese word for 'sex' that came from the pronunciation of the letter 'H' that is an abbreviation for the word 'Hentai'. Phew.) and <i>'kei'</i> refers to a type (or even a lineage) of something. <br>Generally put, 'kei' (系) is a classifier for objects (living or non-living) that comes from a tree kind of structure, while 'gata' (型) literally means 'mold' or 'model' and looks at a classification of objects into categories.</p>

<p>All this being said, the <b>official</b> meaning of B-gata H-kei is that the 'B' stands for <i>'Bousou'</i> (暴走), which can be translated to a 'rampage'; and the 'H' stands for <i>'Hentai'</i> (変態), which we know is the word for perverted behavior. So the title refers to how Yamada is a rampaging sex-crazy pervert. </p>

<p>I tell you all these pieces of information because they form a sort of pun. The second explanation is the 'correct' one of sorts (in that it's official), but that does not negate the pun that exists in the title - whether it was intentional or not. There is reason to believe the 'B' could also refer to bra-size, as many people have pointed out. That adds to the pun as well, perhaps.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope this sheds some light on the meaning of 'B型H系'. I can't post too many links here, but check out beta.jisho.org to look up the meanings for the Japanese words I used. Also, this is where I got the 'official' explanation of the title:<br>
<a href=""http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1040891740"">http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1040891740</a> <br>
It's all in Japanese. The person who had answered that question wrote that this explanation wasn't mentioned in the manga, but in a weekly magazine called Young Jump.</p>

<p>Also, this link: <a href=""http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1139264431"">http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1139264431</a><br>
The answer there talks about how the blood types of all characters in the story are actually never mentioned (as of the time of that answer), though the fact that Yamada is a B-cup is known. It also mentions that Yamada as a character is modeled after Sanri Youko (the mangaka) themselves and so speculates that Yamada's blood type could be the same as Sanri-sensei's. (Unfortunately, their blood type is also unknown.)</p>

<p>I'm not a native Japanese speaker (just an enthusiastic learner!) so I might not be entirely correct. But I hope this answer helps, somewhat. Anime titles often have many hidden meanings in them, and it's fun to look for all their possible interpretations.</p>

What if Harutora had to sacrifice his place in the current universe he is in (so he sacrificed his place in the world for Natsume)? So to sum that up, the ritual ""kind of"" worked as Natsume has been placed into the universe she left, but Harutora sacrificed his position. Also, when she got kissed it was somewhat real? Like, being Yakou, he managed to travel to her universe for a period of time. When you see him walk off with his familiars he is in another universe. When he says ""I hope to see you again"" I'm guessing he meant ""hope to see you again in another universe,"" like see her other self in another universe.</p>

<p>I have no idea where this popped out from but this is my theory.</p>

First ""Aiura"" is pronounced the same way as ""iUra"", like an apple product, hence Steve Jobs in the OP. On the other hand the Tale of Heike says that the spirits of samurai who fell during the battle of Dan-no-Ura are carried by Heike crabs, and that's why their backs sort of look like a human face. That explains why there are crabs everywhere in the OP, which happen to also be linked with Steve Jobs since he died from cancer.

Over half of the frames have crabs somewhere, and it has lots of crab-themed parodies, including of CNN and Apple. However, I haven't seen any crabs anywhere in the series other than that (up to episode 5). How are crabs significant to the series (if at all), and why were they featured so prominently in the OP?</p>

<p>I was not able to find this on youtube, but Crunchyroll is streaming the series. Here's the <a href=""http://www.crunchyroll.com/aiura/episode-1-the-day-before-622205"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">first episode</a>; the OP lasts until 1:00.</p>

Other than the final arc (episodes 43-49) which provides some conclusion to the anime, it is episodic content. The final arc is anime-original and quite a bit different from the manga.</p>

<p>A few of the episodes of the anime are based on interlude manga chapters, but they're still episodic and don't forward the plot. These episodes were expanded quite a bit from the manga chapters which were comedic interludes that did not forward the story significantly. Episodes 26, 38, 39, and 40 are the only examples of this I know of, though it's been a while since I've read the manga or watched the anime so I might have missed one. These episodes still have a lot of anime-original content, so if you don't like the filler at all you probably won't enjoy these regardless of whether they're based on the manga.</p>

<p>So, in short, if you want the continuation of the GetBackers story, the only real option is to read the manga. The anime episode 25 corresponds roughly to chapter 83, the end of the ""Return to Infinity Fortress"" arc. The anime does have a bit of manga content after that point, but I doubt it would be worth watching if all you want is the story and you don't enjoy the filler episodes at all.</p>

<p>In episode 4 of <em>Sailor Moon S</em>, Michiru and Haruka observe Mamoru from a distance during and after the concert. (They are sitting some distance away from the five ""confirmed"" Sailor Guardians and Tuxedo Mask, and they have opera glasses. Haruka points out Usagi and her boyfriend, whom Usagi had been complaining of feeling inadequate for, to Michiru.)</p>

<p>In the beginning of episode 9, Mamoru explicitly interacts with Michiru. He has gone with Usagi and the other girls to watch Haruka at a motorcycle race. After the race, Usagi talks to Haruka and Michiru, bringing her friends and Mamoru. (It's worth noting, however, that there is no introduction---""This is Mamoru; this is Haruka and Michiru""---in this episode. Either the introduction is simply handwaved, or they were introduced at an earlier point, before they are <em>shown</em> explicitly interacting for the first time.)</p>

However, usually manga do contain extra content that aren't covered in the anime and OVA(s). So while you don't need to read the manga to watch the anime, you can for an extra bit of info/story.</p>

<p>So you could read the manga on top of watching the anime and OVA(s) for Read or Die, but it's not <strong>necessary</strong> to go through both. It could be fun though.</p>

I still think this is what is intended by this name, though honestly they probably didn't consider translation when creating the name, but I imagine Japaense people would read this the same as if we read ""The B Cupped Slut"" as the title.</p>

Nevertheless, you don't need to watch everything in order to know what is going on now. The start of each arc is an acceptable place to try and pick up the show (though you will miss things obviously).</p>

<p><strong>I would recommend that you start from episode 382</strong>, you will get to know the whole crew a just after they are finally assembled. Before this point there are several entertaining arcs in which the crew progresses through the East Blue and then Grand Line fighting Big Bads and gathers new members.  The current crew becomes whole in episode 381.  You get to see them in one arc together (which provides very important information) and then BIG things happen.  You will meet the characters who are the big players in the world as Luffy does and will get quick overviews of the now underpowered big bads from he previous arcs. This is a major turning point for the show and I don't think there is another good place to pick it up again until episode 517.  If you start there you will have missed the exact badasses you want to see.</p>

<p>Additionally, I would recommend you watch Strong World.  It is a canon movie between (i think) episodes 381 and 382.</p>

<p>Do not think, however, that I am saying that the first 381 episodes are not worth watching.  They are amazing and provide important backstory to every character.</p>

<p>I prefer subs and don't know where to find dubs anywhere but Hulu. Sorry for not being able to answer that part.</p>

<p><strong><em>Humanity Has Declined</em></strong> (人類は衰退しました <em>Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita</em>), or <strong><em>Jintai</em></strong> (人退?) for short is a Light Novel Series written by Romeo Tanaka in 2007. Artwork was originally done by Tōru Yamasaki in the first 6 volumes but in 2011 was replaced by Sunaho Tobe.</p>

<p>The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world where Humanity's numbers are declining while being replaced by the Fairies, small human like creature with permeate smiles, who are considered the New Humanity. the Fairies have incredibly advance technology which could be considered Magic and have a total disregard for human safety. they love sweets and more appear when they are having fun (thought to be how they reproduce)</p>

<p>The main protagonist is an unnamed female, either refered to as ""I"" (わたし <em>Watashi</em>), ""Ms. Sweets"" (お菓子ちゃん <em>Okashi-chan</em>) or by her title as Mediator. As her title describes she is the mediator between Humans and Fairies.</p>

<p>In March 2010 a  the first chapter of a Manga adaptation of the Light Novel illustrated by Rei Neyuki was released in that month's issue of Shogakukan's <em>Monthly Ikki</em> magazine but in May the Manga had gone on an indefinite hiatus and was ultimately cancelled. Takuya Mitomi illustrated a second Manga titled <strong><em>Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita: Nonbirishita Hōkoku</em></strong> (人類は衰退しました のんびりした報告) which was serialized in <em>Monthly Ikki</em> from January till July of 2012 with a single tankōbon released in July 2012. </p>

<p>Mitomi also illustrated <strong><em>Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita: Nonbirishita Hōkoku 4-koma</em></strong> (人類は衰退しました　のんびりした4コマ), a 4-panel comic strip which began silealization in august 2012 issue of <em>Monthly Ikki</em>. a third Manga titled <strong><em>Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita: Yōsei, Shimasu ka</em></strong> (人類は衰退しました ようせい、しますか), illustrated by Terae Kichijō was serialized in  Media Factory's <em>Monthly Comic Alive</em> from March 2012 with the first volume of it release in June 2012 and as of February 2013 there have been 3 Volumes released.</p>

The characters of the show are all in ""B Class"" (second year HS students) and ""H Group"" (homeroom H).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Incidentally, R.O.D. started as light novels and manga published at the same time.</p>

<p>As with all OVAs I've seen, while you may be able to watch them and get some understanding of what's going on without reading the original source material, they are usually short and made on the assumption that people who already like the source will be the audience.  Therefore, they tend to rush through exposition, and even skip over details that they assume the audience is already aware of.  As I remember (it has been a while since I watched) it seems that in the case of the R.O.D. OVA, this meant they had very little explanation of the events that happened a few years before.  So probably you would get more out of it if you went back and read the manga or light novels.</p>

In the original ending, the miracle occurs instead when Takano shoots at Hanyuu in the mountain forest and misses her shot.</p>

<p>The adult version of Rika is most likely Bernkastel. Her real nature/identity is often questioned and discussed by fans, most notably those who know the series ""Umineko no Naku Koro ni"" by the same author; however, a direct and clear link between the Bernkastel from both series is not established.
From a simple Higurashi point of view, at least, Bernkastel is an entity born from Rika's ""mature personnality"" due to her many reincarnations. It is speculated that while Rika is still in the fragment where she won with her friends and live a peaceful life there, Bernkastel was able to become a separate existence that can freely travels between the different fragments (= alternative realities).</p>

Countries in North America and others where the Funimation dub was aired first usually had Dragon Ball Z aired first.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.kanzenshuu.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=30285"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.kanzenshuu.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=30285</a></p>

<p>The list of countries is not exhaustive. However, I'd like to point out ""Why most of the countries (western world, and to Japan that is nearly the rest of the world) Dragon ball Z aired first.</p>

<p>Anime was an experimental thing in most nations outside of Japan. Dragonball was an exceptional manga and its first Anime adaptation did well in Japan. Dragon Ball creator was not happy with the first adaptation though and had a reboot in form of Z when Goku grew up. This was even more popular.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kazuhiko Torishima, Akira Toriyama's editor for Dr. Slump and the first half of Dragon Ball, felt that the Dragon Ball anime's ratings were gradually declining because it had the same producer that worked on Dr. Slump. Torishima said this producer had this ""cute and funny"" image connected to Toriyama's work and was missing the more serious tone in the newer series, and therefore asked the studio to change the producer. Impressed with their work on Saint Seiya, he asked its director Kōzō Morishita and writer Takao Koyama to help ""reboot"" Dragon Ball, which coincided with Son Goku growing up. The new producer explained that ending the first anime and creating a new one would result in more promotional money, and the result was the start of Dragon Ball Z. <br><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z#Production_and_broadcasting"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source - Dragon Ball Z (Wikipedia)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Western media channels decided to pick up Dragonball Z as an experimental thing. It started airing in 1996, but halted after some episodes. However, when it began airing on Cartoon Network's Toonami block, it got huge boost in the popularity. Due to the success of the reruns, FUNimation began its in house dub of DBZ. </p>

<p>It is reasonable to assume that, due to the success of DBZ, the media houses decided to cash in on all the positive reviews and started airing Dragon Ball as well. After the success of DBZ in North America other markets also started airing DBZ and then followed by Dragon Ball.</p>

Even now (2016) when some companies are adding more shoujo titles to their catalogs, they are still more hesitant to invest in shoujo at the same rate they invest in shounen, and the titles to appeal to girls/women licensed lean towards reverse harem, its cousin the newer bishounen subgenre, and yaoi.</p>

<p>Good news, though. More companies are crowdfunding left-behind licenses, and Pied Piper, the company that rescued and released Time of Eve, is running a Kickstarter for a North American release of Skip Beat.

As far as I know the river gates were never explained, but they have been shown. In chapter 1 you can see the river flow through the walls and in chapter 73 you can see in more detail how the river flows freely in and out the walls through bars. I assume them to be able to open similarly to the regular gates. They have not been attacked and it has not been explained why. At this point it makes more sense to attack the regular gates than the bars, seeing we don't even known whether <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/13446/can-the-titans-swim"">Titans can even swim</a>.</p>

<p>For an example, in episode 17 of the <em>Railgun</em> anime, Komoe-sensei mentions how she likes all her students, even the ones that blow up her roof, which is probably a reference to when Index used Dragon's Breath (episode 6 of <em>Index</em>). </p>

<p>The manga gives a better frame of reference, since it gives a exact date (July 16th). 
So the events in <em>Railgun</em> begin 4 days before the Index novel (July 20th), where Touma first meets Index. Touma <a href=""http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index%3aVolume1_Prologue"">meets</a> Mikoto on the eve of July 19th. </p>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun?from=Manga.ToAruKagakuNoRailgun"">TV Tropes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The anime, however, violates this by adapting events from Volume 8 of the novels into the anime's first episode. As it stands, Chapters 18 to 39 occur around the time of Volume 3 in the novels, Chapter 40 is around volume 5, Chapters 41-42 and around volume 8 and Chapters 43-current take place around volume 9.</p>

<p>The ""specials"" (usually called ""Psycho Pass: New Edit"" or ""Psycho Pass: Extended Edition"", I think) are a re-cut/updated version of season 1, <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/14021/1908"">with only minor changes</a>. The reason there are only 11 of them is that they're double-length.

Quality changes are just because this anime exists for about 15 years, so it's only natural for the video quality itself to improve over time.

Episodes 517+ happen in a time called ""post-timeskip"" and in ""the new world"".

<li>Although the episode length is the same (23 minutes), the size has increased (60 MB and more), though it is because of HD quality.</li>

I actually watched Sailor Moon with Dutch dubs (based on the English version so I got double the misery) and saw the Japanese version after that and got so confused about it. The Japanese and the English version have the same name but that is about the only thing these two have in common. So no, to me ""some"" does not even come close.</p>

<p>Each episode was different from the original Japanese version: any form of violence, nudity, death, swearing and gay relationships or gay behaviour was taken out. </p>

<p>Even the main theme of love was not as highly present in the English as in the Japanese. The English theme song is a superhero song:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,<br>
  I can say it in my dreams<br>
  My thoughts are about to short circuit,<br>
  I want to see you right now</p>

<p>versus...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fighting evil by moonlight,<br>
  Winning love by daylight,<br>
  Never running from a real fight,<br>
  She is the one named Sailor Moon</p>

<p>People actually die in the Japanese version. Something that surprised me even more since I was still used to it being a naive censored version.</p>

"20400","2","","19580","2015-03-28 15:25:11","","6","","<p>It probably makes the most sense to watch <em>Death Billiards</em> before <em>Death Parade</em> because it is a pilot episode and the TV series makes a passing reference to the bar customers from the movie. Chronologically speaking, the story of <em>Death Billiards</em> takes place sometime after episode 5 and before episode 10 of <em>Death Parade</em>.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> If you take note of the roulette board in <em>Death Billiards</em>, it actually featured <em>Chavvot</em>. This roulette board was only switched in from the beginning of episode 5 of <em>Death Parade</em> at Nona's request. In the first four episodes of <em>Death Parade</em> (and in episode 6 at Ginti's bar), the roulette board only had a generic symbol on it.<br>
<br>
 The old woman who died and arrived at Quindecim in episode 10 of <em>Death Parade</em> was revealed to be the wife of the old man in <em>Death Billiards</em>, as shown on her set of cards and in her flashback. Also, during a flashback of the old man in <em>Death Billiards</em>, it was hinted that he passed away before his wife. Therefore, <em>Death Billiards</em> should occur before episode 10 of <em>Death Parade</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>@nhahtdh made a good argument that we could further restrict the occurrence of the events in <em>Death Billiards</em> to that before episode 8</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> if we take Chiyuki's mentality into consideration. She couldn't have been as relaxed as was shown at the end of <em>Death Billiards</em> if she had just sat through the trial of the two killers in episodes 8 and 9.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to watch <em>Death Billiards</em> in between the <em>Death Parade</em> episodes, you should watch it after episode 6 and before episode 7 (or 8, the next best choice) because the only billiards game in <em>Death Parade</em> is played in episode 7, which lasted only about 90 seconds and commenced without any explanation to the rules of the game, so it would be a nice continuity to finish the movie first and then jump back to watch episode 7.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Watch <em>Death Billiards</em> either before episode 1 or in-between episodes 6 and 7 of <em>Death Parade</em>.</p>

"340","1","362","","2012-12-13 16:27:34","","17","78993","<p>At the end of each Cowboy Bebop, there is a phrase (or a title card, as the <a href=""http://cowboybebop.wikia.com/wiki/Memorable_Quotes_from_Cowboy_Bebop#Ending_Title_Cards_in_Order_of_Episodes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cowboy Bebop Wiki</a> calls them). In most of the sessions, the phrase reads <strong>""See You space cowboy...""</strong>.<br>
<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/aUrI8iI.jpg"" width=""250"" height=""188""><br>
However, there are some variations:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Session 3: <strong>""Easy Come, Easy Go...""</strong> - It is (most likely) a reference to how easy it is to win and lose money in a casino, since this episode takes place in one.  </li>
<li>Session 11: <strong>""The End""</strong> - I actually don't know if this is a reference, or simply a classic <em>'The End'</em>.</li>
<li>Session 12: <strong>""To Be Continued ""</strong> - It simply states the fact that this episode is a <em>Part 1</em>, and the story is to be continued in the next session.  </li>
<li><p>Session 13: <strong>""Do You Have a comrade? ""</strong> - It is a reference to:  </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> the relationship that Gren had with Vicious, and the fact that Spike helps him in the end.  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Session 15: <strong>""Sleeping Beast""</strong> - It is a reference to <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>, since:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Faye was 'asleep' too (preserved in a cryogenic state). But I am not sure about the <em>Beast</em> part.  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Session 17: <strong>""Life is but a dream...""</strong> - Is a reference to the events that take place during the episode, namely</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> their hallucinations.  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Session 22: <strong>""See You Space Samurai... ""</strong> - It is a reference to</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Andy's transformation (from cowboy to samurai) in the end of the episode.  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Session 23: <strong><em>None</em></strong> - Don't know if this even needs to <em>have</em> a reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Session 24: <strong>""See You Cowgirl, Someday, Somewhere!""</strong> - It is a reference to</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Ed (and Ein) parting from the rest of the crew.  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Session 25: <strong>""To Be Continued ""</strong> - Again, simply a reference to the fact that this episode is a <em>Part 1</em>, and the story is to be continued in the next session.  </p></li>
<li>Session 26: <strong>""You're gonna carry that weight.""</strong> - <strong>???</strong><br>
<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/tBMRE9g.jpg"" width=""250"" height=""188""></li>
</ul>

<p>So, what is the meaning of such a phrase, at the end of the last session? Does the author have some message that he wants to pass with this phrase? Or is it simply a reference to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_That_Weight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">eponymous Beatles' song</a>? </p>

It's very similar to the current series and you could probably drop it in as a longer episode.</p>

<p>Some of the surprises will have already been revealed in Death Parade, but it should still be entertaining as it's mostly focusing on the billiards, rather than what goes on behind the bar.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The anime is generally faithful to the manga (the source material) in terms of important plot points. The anime is quite close to the manga for the first few episodes, then it starts to skip many events in the later half. Notably:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mizuka arc, where Murakami and the girls tried to escape from Mizuka, a rank AAA magic user with precognition ability. Mizuka's power can project herself into the future, where she interferes with people's decision to make her vision comes true. The anime skips the whole arc.</li>
<li>Yuki Tsuchiya, debuting during Mizuka arc as a new employee of The Organization, is skipped in the anime along with Mizuka arc. In the manga, she serves mostly as an excuse to let readers have a look inside The Organization and their treatment towards magic users.</li>
<li>Kitsuka, who is Murakami's student and has a crush on him, followed Murakami and the girls on their trip to the beach in the manga. This is omitted in the anime. Although this detail being removed doesn't affect the ending of the anime, it is connected to the story after chapter 100 and may confuse you a bit.</li>
<li>Many details in the last few episodes of the anime are trimmed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, I recommend everyone to take a look at the manga for the full experience.</p>

"32132","2","","32129","2016-05-15 20:44:13","","6","","<p>It's based on bon odori, the dancing at O-bon festivals. O-bon is a holiday in Japan that takes place towards the end of summer. All the ""summer festivals"" in anime where people dress in yukata and go eat yakisoba and scoop goldfish and watch fireworks are O-bon festivals.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g58qwUQtoG8"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> is a video that shows some people doing bon-odori. The video description offers some facts about the dancing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bon Odori (盆踊り), meaning simply Bon dance is a style of dancing performed during Obon. Originally a Nenbutsu folk dance to welcome the spirits of the dead, the style of celebration varies in many aspects from region to region. Each region has a local dance, as well as different music. The music can be songs specifically pertinent to the spiritual message of Obon, or local min'yo folk songs. Consequently, the Bon dance will look and sound different from region to region. Hokkaidō is known for a folk-song known as ""Soran Bushi."" The song ""Tokyo Ondo"" takes its namesake from the capital of Japan. ""Gujo Odori"" in Gujō, Gifu prefecture is famous for all night dancing. ""Goshu Ondo"" is a folk song from Shiga prefecture. Residents of the Kansai area will recognize the famous ""Kawachi ondo."" Tokushima in Shikoku is very famous for its ""Awa Odori,"" or ""fool's dance,"" and in the far south, one can hear the ""Ohara Bushi"" of Kagoshima.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, Tsukihi is well known as a yukata freak who joined the tea ceremony club just to have an excuse to wear a yukata at school, and bon odori is often done in yukata. (You can even kind of see how the movements of the dance, which mostly involve the hands and arms, are adapted to the leg-restricting nature of the garment.) So that's why her opening features her doing bon odori.</p>

<p>Some parallels that fit with this are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When Regan explains the World Fraction spell, and Shiroe reverse engineers the time line to coincide the beginning of its first use to the start of the open beta.  I don't recall if EQ had an open beta, but it did release in '99.  The screen show indicated '98, so this is plausible.</p></li>
<li><p>The most powerful guild in Akihabara is D.D.D. Their legendary exploits coincide with the early and buggy release of Kyrafrim after the defeat of Ventani.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Are there other events, probably.  I can't recall them off the top of my head.  Could those events coincide with other game changers from other MMO's?  Likely.  But EQ was my first.  </p>

First, his father shows hom that his daughter and him may ultimately end up misunderstanding each other - that his fathers pride is how he ended up without family. this is clearly shown by his refusal of money and his lack of food or water even. 
nigasas parents also suggested a timeline where nigasa survives. nigasas parents, although loving, ultinately were ill prepared for a child. the fact that the lack of experience or tragedy blinds them to the fact thtlat a child needs more than love and fun. nigasas illness and desth may ultimately have allowed him to push past his own selfish needs to become the father his daughter needed. his coworkers fiances sister illustrates another example of the utility of pain and loss. also seems to suggest that wishing for another chance to choose does not prevent loss or death or love. also. i kinda got the feeling that nigasa and his daughter coud not exist in the same world. i got the sense his daughter like an afterthought. a lot of his inner monolgue seemed to be about showing the world he wasnt a bad dather. his child was left alone much like nigasa was after his grandma guilt tripped him. his last rwquest to his dsughter was stop making it hard for your dad to take care of your illnrss. abyways. he doesnt seem to understand people in terms of their feelings but only in regard to himself. </p>

"3015","2","","3010","2013-03-23 23:45:27","","24","","<p>First off, <em>Dragon Ball Z Kai</em> doesn't include anything from <em>Dragon Ball</em>, which is the story of Goku as a child. Secondly, the main difference is that <em>Kai</em> lacks the filler content of the original <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, and stops at the end of the Cell saga. </p>

<p>By filler I mean content not originally in the manga. Some (like myself enjoyed the filler), while others though it to be extra fluff. <em>Kai</em> is more faithful to the manga, than the original anime was. In some cases though, this could affect how some see the development of characters. For example: In the original <em>DBZ</em>, one of the most intriguing, and perhaps touching moments is Gohan surviving in alone in the wilderness. The challenges &amp; events he faces, as well as the people he meet all influence the person he becomes later on. Much of this was cut in Kai, and so unless you've already seen <em>DBZ</em> it might seem a little choppy.</p>

<p>By ending at the Cell saga, it ends in the place where the original author Akira Toriyama wanted it to. In doing so, you miss the about two-three seasons that came afterward.</p>

<p>The are also other small differences between the two: including different music in some cases, and new scenes added/redone in <em>Kai</em>.</p>

<p>As for censorship, some scenes where updated to fit the new standards of Japanese Television. In American productions of the anime (namely dubs), there could have been further censoring. I can't remember the name of the company at the moment, but one when so far as to make the character Mr. Popo blue, as to lessen claims of racism.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yVlIn.jpg"" alt=""Scene edited to remove blood""> <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VBWu9.png"" alt=""Mr. Popo&#39;s skin is normally pitch black.""></p>

<p>Given the facts, you can make up your mind as to which you will watch, but in my humble opinion I would go with the originals first, and later on, if you want, you can look into <em>Kai</em> as an abridgment. As someone who has personally watch both, I must say that I only enjoyed <em>Kai</em> because I was able to fill in the details myself. If I had never seen <em>DBZ</em> I doubt I would have felt this comfortable.</p>

<p>I hope I helped! :) </p>

<p>The adult version of Rika is most likely Bernkastel. Her real nature/identity is often questioned and discussed by fans, most notably those who know the series ""Umineko no Naku Koro ni"" by the same author; however, a direct and clear link between the Bernkastel from both series is not established.
From a simple Higurashi point of view, at least, Bernkastel is an entity born from Rika's ""mature personnality"" due to her many reincarnations. It is speculated that while Rika is still in the fragment where she won with her friends and live a peaceful life there, Bernkastel was able to become a separate existence that can freely travels between the different fragments (= alternative realities).</p>

<p>Basically, if society can treat them as monsters for having the sort of romantic feelings they want, then society will accept them, feelings and all.  Thought the ""eat"" metaphor was fairly straightforward in context.  o.o;</p>

In the second part of the 13th episode we see a preview of the next season and the moments shown are mainly from the 5th and 6th volume.
{Source: I own all of the translated volumes and have watched the anime}
Aku no Hana (The Flowers of Evil) original manga by Shuzo Oshimi was recently concluded at 11 volumes.</p>

<p>As for the second part of your question, the anime staff have taken quite a few liberties in the direction of the anime. Major plot points are of course included in the anime adaptation. The <strong>main plot</strong> is the same, but as with many anime adaptations some scenes were cut off, others were a little changed. What is more, some reactions from the characters are different in some scenes, which gives the viewer a slightly different image of the character. I can't give you specific differences though (which as I said don't alter the plot, so no worries there), without possibly spoiling the story for you, as you didn't mention how many episodes of the anime you have watched.</p>

<p>Also, a special episode at the end of volume three isn't included in the anime adaptation and I doubt it will be, except perhaps as an OVA, as it is a small story about Nakamura and another guy back in middle school.</p>

<p>One major difference, irrelevant to the plot, is the artwork, which is absolutely different, and as a result the ""feel"" of the characters and the atmosphere that both versions give to the audience/reader are different.</p>

<p>Knowing that this shouldn't be part of my answer, I would however strongly recommend reading the great manga that Aku no Hana is.</p>

"7039","2","","6725","2014-01-19 14:55:01","","2","","<p>SAO and LH are not based on any existing MMO. Depending on which MMORPG's you have played you will likely find certain aspects of the world to be incredibly consistent with it.</p>

<p>The grand-daddy of all MMORPG's as they play right now is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Online"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ultima Online</a> (which I played during beta) as the crafting and ""loss of experience upon death"" both originated here, and it even predates <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverQuest"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EverQuest</a>, as you could craft in previous Ultima games since at least Ultima 4 (magic spells), 6 and 7 (food). Likewise, player-owned housing originates in Ultima Online.</p>

<p>As far as Asian MMORPG's influence, LH's world is a bit more consistent with Final Fantasy XIV (and likely XI), while SAO is very consistent with Mabinogi. In game, marriage is something that was introduced in a Nexon game that predates Mabinogi (called NexusTK:Kingdom of the Winds, which is a game I also played during beta).</p>

<p>Dungeon Raids, as they are in SAO and LH, are shown as a type of instancing system which is fairly consistent with the advent of 3D modern MMORPG's, though based on the explicit references to roles (eg Tank) and menu driven combat with cooldown's, this might have its origins in EverQuest, but this is fairly consistent with FFXI/FFXIV at present.</p>

<p>The respawn rules, how monsters respawn in the same area, which is something that both Ultima Online and NexusTK did in 1998.</p>

<p>Guilds is a strange aspect. The original 2D MMORPG's never had guilds (it may have originated in Lineage) and it was just something people started doing, so later games actually introduced it as a game mechanic (and indeed the entire point of Guild Wars). Likewise, the PK elements were also something that existed originally in UO, but EverQuest was probably the first to see abuse of it, as in SAO.</p>

<p>Take for example the pets and mounts. In LH the pet griffon mount is also a flying mount that is available in Mabonogi. Likewise in SAO, Silica has a combat pet. Combat pets have been in MMORPG's for quite a while. However, virtual pets actually originated with Tamagotchi's, which actually die if you don't take care of them. So again depending on your point of view.</p>

<p>As for the races and classes, SAO was primarily humans, while SAO:Alfhiem is actually based on Lore from ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" which is Shakespeare. The races in LH are the standard human-like characters from Tolkien (LOTR) with the were-animal races (which the current game out there that has these is TERA).</p>

<p>And to round this out, the ""Fighter, Wizard, Thief, Cleric"" type of roles originate in tabletop D&amp;D games, but the way they are used (Tank, DPS, Healer) originates in Wizardry, which was more popular in Japan than it was in the West. Permadeath (SAO) also originates in Wizardry. </p>

<p>In respect to LH, since there is a specific reference to 1998.10.22 and the character in episode 14 specifically mentions 8 levels of magic which is also something that Ultima has. Like if you want to use the date as a piece of proof, that means the game in question would have been in open beta on or after 1998.10.22, which chronologically can only be EverQuest. I've personally played the EverQuest Beta in 1998. </p>

<p>In one of the most recent episodes of LH (you need to pay close attention) you'll also realize that they are partied with an NPC. Most MMORPG's don't let you adhoc have any NPC join, they either are temporary for a quest (escort missions), or summonable partners/pets.</p>

<p>So as you see, it depends on which games you've played. When I talked to friends about SAO, they can find individual aspects of it that they related to their MMORPG of choice. Over time (at least since WoW) most games have borrowed ideas from each other enough that they're all becoming exactly the same game. They're only differing by environment (Fantasy like SAO), race/monster names (many are derived from Tolkien/D&amp;D) and cost to play. </p>

<p>So there is no one right answer, as no single game introduced everything seen in SAO and LH at launch. You can read comics/manga like 1/2 Prince or Yureka that also deal with virtual worlds and you'll see much of the same elements there as well. </p>

<p>The interesting moral question that comes up again in all of these stories based on MMORPG's is ""are we losing our humanity"" by when we treat AI's as tools.</p>

Occasionally, they will make references to it having been months since a previous case or other reference point, but these do not seem to line up much, if at all, and generally they are intended to indicate a time period for the individual case or arc, so that elements such as Ran's waiting for Shinichi seems to have actually been over a period of time. These indications, for obvious reasons, cannot always coincide, and so it would seem that the author decided long ago to make the story timeless. If you want a clear answer of the main plotline, so far it has been only for a few months, while the numerous side cases do not fit into this framework.</p>

<p>Netflix has done a lot of internal work on retention analysis - both for keeping paid subscribers, and for series watchers themselves (as that will increase the subscribers' enjoyment and reduce their consideration to leave).  I couldn't find any figures on this, but I presume the drop-off rate of series is lower when episodes are all released at once - Viewers can watch more than a single episode in their first viewing, meaning they will be more involved in the plot by the time they next sit down to watch something.</p>

<p>The way the Crunchyroll model works, the episodes were only available to premium members during the first few weeks of release - this might have also convinced users to subscribe.</p>

<p>While Netflix has done this primarily to non animated works, Re:Life is not the first instance of this bundled release. <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/ie/title/80075595"">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a> was released in this form earlier this year.</p>

In principle I can find quotes from the VN to support everything here, but that seems like a pretty arduous task given the size of the VN.</p>

<p>Of course, what follows constitute pretty major spoilers if you ever intend to read the VN regarding the illusionary world and the ""lights"", though . Some of this is not discussed in any way in the anime, so I've spoiler tagged everything (but if you don't ever intend to read the VN, there's no reason not to spoil yourself).</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In the visual novel, there are a number of ""<a href=""http://clannad.wikia.com/wiki/Light_orbs"">orbs of light</a>"" which are also in the anime but not focused on as much. Yukine describes them to Tomoya at the end of her route, and I believe also at some point in the anime. They are capable of granting wishes, but are fairly limited in power. They are created when someone helps someone else achieve a goal which brings happiness. For unknown reasons, Tomoya is one of the few people who can see them now, although they were visible to everyone in the past. In the game, Tomoya gets one orb for each completed route (8 total), with a couple of exceptions, and 5 more are available in After-Story. All of these are needed to reach the true end where Nagisa and Ushio don't die. <br><br>
After Tomoya collects the orbs, they are transported to the illusionary world, where Ushio (the true identity of the girl who lives there) keeps them. Ushio created the illusionary world in order to save herself and Nagisa by collecting the fragments of happiness that Tomoya gathers in the form of orbs of light. She is capable of doing so because ""children are the culmination of their parents' hopes and dreams"" (a theme that is repeated many times in the series). <br><br>
The only other people who are able to enter the illusionary world are those who willingly choose to do so, and Tomoya is the only person who falls into that category, so he is able to enter the body of a doll made out of garbage. Even when they made another doll, there were no more souls willing to enter the illusionary world, so it was lifeless. It isn't clear whether Ushio and Tomoya in the illusionary world have their real world memories, but Tomoya in the real world definitely doesn't remember the illusionary world, as evidenced by the fact that he thinks Nagisa's play is nostalgic but doesn't know why (Nagisa's play was about the illusionary world, although she probably also doesn't know this). It's also not clear how the chronologies of the two worlds works, but it's very likely that they are on completely different timelines. Judging by the fact that all of the illusionary world segments occur between days, he may be seeing it as a dream, but the research of the Ichinoses (Kotomi's parents, both of whom are theoretical physicists) indicates that the illusionary world is very much real and is connected to our world in many ways. <br><br>
In order to save Nagisa and Ushio, Tomoya needs to do 3 things. First, he needs to gather a lot of happiness in the form of orbs of light, enough to make such a big wish. Second, he needs to clearly tell Ushio (who is holding the orbs via her alter-ego in the illusionary world) that he doesn't want her or Nagisa to die and that he wants them to live together as a family. And third, he needs to really mean what he is saying, as the orbs won't grant wishes that aren't what one truly desires. If all of those are completed, the orbs of light will grant his wish, returning time to the point when Ushio was born and saving both Nagisa and Ushio. It should be mentioned that in order to collect these orbs, Ushio sends Tomoya to many different timelines, each time returning him to around the same point when the anime begins and resetting his memories. This is touched upon briefly in the special episodes revolving around Kyou and Tomoyo in which we see orbs of light at the end, meaning it's likely they're canon and actually happened during one of the timelines Tomoya was sent to.<br><br>
Note also that this isn't the only time that the orbs of light grant wishes that would otherwise be impossible, although it's definitely the most powerful instance. When Nagisa is dying for the first time and Akio wishes to the tree that she doesn't die, that wish was also granted via the orbs. Also, when Misae declares her wish to Shima that she wants him to always be with her and love her, this is also granted, although unbeknownst to Misae, Shima was actually a cat and he returns to that form. In addition, depending on the order of routes that you choose in the VN, Tomoya may use an orb to pray for Fuko to get better, though if he does he'll be able to get it back in After Story. So this isn't as much of a deus ex machina as it might seem, but a legitimate plot point that mostly got swept under the rug in the anime. </p>

We saw the crew of the Bebop desperately try to escape their past lives and we got to know them. We cheered Spike, Jet and Faye on throughout the series until Spike essentially brought everything to a close by choosing to see if he was 'truly alive'. From here we're left with the idea that Jet and Faye will likely move on and everything has come full circle (Jet was still a bounty hunter for some time before meeting Spike, Faye drifted from planet to planet trying to come to terms with her mysterious past, Ed may have found her father again or maybe she's back to what she did before meeting the Bebop crew.)</p>

<p>""You're gonna carry that weight"" is a reference to the fact that we're the ones who'll be carrying the emotional ""weight"" (Spike's death, and the end of the Bebop's adventures) of the ending, thats what we'll take away from it.</p>

  <p> Julia dies on Spike's hands. Shin dies too, hinting that if Vicious is killed, Spike wil become the new leader of Syndicate (and if you think Spike survived, you might think that this <em>is</em> the weight he's gonna carry). Finally, he kills Vicious. If you think about it, Spike has finished his business regarding the syndicate and Vicious. But while doing it he also loses Julia.

I personally thing that this moment of ""incompleteness"" is what makes animes like this great: everyone may find the explanation that suits him better. So this intentionally open ending allows you to chose the one explanation that is most suitable for you ;)</p>

Maybe the mangaka felt about it like this as well but just didn't want to put too much attention on her either since Tatsumi is the main character overall. Think about it for a second. Akame gets the most in depth background story of all the female characters in the anime. She's by far the most interesting one as well. Also, the anime ends with her standing at the end dealing the final fight. Not Tatsumi. Not Mine. Not Sheele. Not Leo. No. Akame. So therefore, Akame ga Kill.</p>

And by that I don't mean the ones that are in the manga.</p>

<p>I mean canon as in something in the story line moves along and it's not just a 'guess who did it'-case.</p>

<p>There are only in about maybe 300 canon eps where the storyline is moved along in 750-ish anime eps. And stuff like 'The Clash of Red and Black', 'Homles Revalation' and 'Jet Black Mystery Train' are many eps long but they are only over the span of 1-3 days each time.
Plus many cases are 2-4 eps but happen in a day or just overnight.</p>

<p>There are times where the characters will say it's been this long or that long but they are few and far in bewteen.</p>

<p>I would say that only about 6-ish months have passed since the start of Detective Conan. </p>

<p>The fact that tech in the show changes and the seasons change is simply because Aoyama-sensei the anime staff have been writing the show in real life for many years.</p>

Moreover, the demon, what Otonashi calls a <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yBiOHl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""monster""</a>, that Hisako turned into resembles the <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/weSNXl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">monsters</a> in <em>Red Garden</em>.</li>

<p>Angel slashing the shadows (Ep 11) looks like a reference to General Grievous from Star Wars (in his fight against Obi Wan on Utapau).</p>

<p>The Knockin' on Heaven's Door (Ep 12) is a reference to the Guns'n'Roses version, or rather to the Guns'n'Roses lead singer Axl Rose (who is blonde and often wears a red headband):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kkVbP.png"" alt=""Axl Rose on Stage in Israel""></p>

"19663","2","","18739","2015-02-25 10:46:49","","12","","<p>To reiterate, アカメが斬る (<em>Akame ga Kiru</em>) means ""Akame cuts/slices/kills"". <em>Kiru</em> also has another meaning: ""to perform surgical incision"", though the kanji is 切る in the case of this definition. This aligns well with the settings of the series: the goal of Akame and her group is to perform the necessary surgery on the corrupted empire by eliminating the tumors.</p>

<p>What is missing in the title are the objects, the targets that Akame kills. In episode 1, Tatsumi said 「俺が斬る」 (<em>Ore ga Kiru</em>), which means ""let me kill (her)"" or ""I'll kill (her)"". Even though there was no object specified, we could infer whom Tatsumi would kill. As for whom and what Akame kills, アカメが(Xを)斬る, the object X can be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Akame_ga_Kill!_chapters#Akame_ga_Kill.21"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">any of those in the chapter titles</a>. Granted, it wasn't always Akame who did the killings, but she is actually a personification of Death (see explanation below) because her lethal and efficient one-cut-kill is befitting of Reaper's Scythe.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does it mean that Akame is Death itself, or Akame is Dead (Not physically, but mentally - that she is dead inside).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, that is my thought exactly. In episode 24,</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Esdeath remarked that Akame is no longer human. It makes sense because Murasame's one-cut-kill doesn't work on non-human beings, or more precisely, beings without a beating heart, which is why Akame didn't die after cutting herself with it because she became Death. Also at the end, Akame said ""I can only kill"" because that is her newly acquired job as Death. Najenda and Akame, the only two survivors of Night Raid in the anime, actually symbolize Life and Death, as shown by them wearing <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oKIjE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">capes of opposite colors</a> and carrying out opposite roles of constructing and destroying for the new empire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Akame was just an ordinary member of Night Raid, yet the show is named after her. She wasn't the main Protagonist, she wasn't even the main Waifu!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Mononoke#Production"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Princess Mononoke</a> is also named after San who is not the main protagonist, even though Hayao Miyazaki had originally preferred the title <em>The Legend of Ashitaka</em> and even went as far as to create a new kanji for <em>legend</em> (sekki). Although Akame is not the main protagonist, like San, she is still indispensable to the plot, especially in a symbolic way.</p>

<p>Why not name the series <em>Ore ga Kiru</em> or <em>Tatsumi ga Kiru</em>? Well, because it wouldn't be as intriguing as <em>Akame ga Kiru</em>. The readers would get hooked on who is Akame and why does she have <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">red eyes</a>, the literal meaning of <em>akame</em>. (In Chinese, it so happens that there is a phrase 殺紅了眼 to describe a person who goes berserk from killing too many people that his eyes turn red.) It's red eyes and not black eyes because the story is full of the so-called ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">leftist</a>"" ideas, hence the oft regarded <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_colour"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">color of the left</a>. Subjectivity aside, the ordering also matters: <em>a</em> is both the first letter in the English alphabet and the first character in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goj%C5%ABon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gojuuon</a>, so <em>Akame ga Kiru</em> will pop up earlier in searches than the alternatives.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>As the Minoshiro explains, necessity dictates that the human society on the brink of destruction must be reformed into a society of love, like the bonobos (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo</a>). It is assumed that the grafting of bonobo DNA into the human genome causes certain attributes to be transferred. One of the explained behaviors is the relieving of stress through sexual activities (as observed in episode 5, when captured, Saki and Satoru engage in such activities to reduce their axiety and fear). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Combining this information with real-world information can then be extrapolated as:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>One of the other observed behaviors in the bonobo, is the bi-sexual nature, which is present in apes (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals#Bonobo_and_other_apes"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals#Bonobo_and_other_apes</a>). To form a society of love as the intention was, it can be assumed that the effect is already present in the human genome and may have been strengthened by the DNA grafting. Saki and Maria have a similar relationship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, why did they include these scenes?</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>That's the background of the humans and thus a critical part of the story.</p>

  <p> Cell stomps and crushes Android 16's head after he's done telling
 Gohan to embrace his inner anger to defeat Cell. In Dragonball Kai,
 this is cut out and only Android 16's brain cartridge and a few bolts
 are seen MAGICALLY on the scene. Yet During the Frieza saga you get to
 see Krillin use 'Destructo Disc' to cut off Frieza's tail which did
 happen in both Z and Kai but this clashes with the head crushing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me Dragonball Z DESTROYS Kai in every form and shape because its more influential in all the characters development. Not to mention I've yet to see Yamcha use his technique The Wolf Fang Fist.</p>

<p>From what I've read as well we are going to lose out on the Majin Buu Saga, the Kid Buu Saga and the Super Android 17 Saga.</p>

<p>Lastly it hasn't been mentioned from what I've read but even though it's only a filler what happened to the Garlic Jr saga? If I remember correctly it was based after the return from Namek. I could be wrong. So much is cut from Z, it's sort of depressing.</p>

I'll stick to recurring characters and exclude filler arcs, as I haven't watched those. For the exact episode numbers refer to <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Arcs"">this page</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to skip to where <em>all the big badass characters like Ace and WhiteBeard are involved</em> you should <strong>skip to the Marineford Arc</strong>. In that arc you will see an all-out war going down between Whitebeard and the Marines to save Ace. I would recommend you to <strong>start at the Sabaody Archipelago Arc</strong> though, where a lot of new characters were introduced that will recur in the story. You could skip inbetween arcs if you want. If you would do so, you'd only have missed the introduction of Franky and Brook and the backstory on Robin.</p>

<p>Assuming the cases appear in chronological order. You'll notice that none of the characters ever age or even graduate. There are many discrepancies the Eisuke/Kir Arc alone has some serious and problematic time discrepancies. It starts with the Nail and Snake Arc which took place a week or so after New Years and then continues to some cases later in the Clash of Red and Black arc which climaxing in a <em>certain</em> person's death. Eisuke vanished around 18th to 19th of December... so chronologically speaking a year should have passed... but did it? Ask Gosho Aoyama.</p>

So the only thing that's in order is the first episode. From there, we have probably 5 cases going on at a time, and when he solves one he goes on to another.  Every day he has a case to solve, whether it's one from weeks before or not. </p>

<p>My second theory is that even if we say each episode represented a day, which it doesn't, at least a year would have passed based on the number of episodes, and Ayumi and the rest shouldn't be in grade 1 anymore.  As a result, the only logical explanation is time overlaps!</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Chaos;Head</em> happens in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya"">Shibuya</a> and the events happen one year before <em>Steins;Gate</em></li>
<li><em>Steins;Gate</em> happens in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara"">Akihabara</a></li>
<li><em>Robotic;Notes</em> happens in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanegashima"">Tanegashima</a> Island and the events happen nine years after <em>Steins;Gate</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The events of <em>Chaos;Head</em> are consistent with the events of <em>Steins;Gate</em> within the Beta worldline, divergence ratio: 1.130426%. <em>Steins;Gate</em> and <em>Robotics;Note</em> exist on the ""Steins;Gate"" worldline, divergence ratio: 1.048596%. (<em>Steins;Gate</em> was also originally in the same worldline as <em>Chaos;Head</em>, which changed after Okabe sent the first D-Mail and passed to another worldline.)</p>

<p>There is a mention of ""Knight Hart"" which is the online persona of <em>Chaos;Head</em>'s protagonist Nishijou Takumi, in episode 4 of <em>Steins;Gate</em>. In the <em>Steins;Gate</em> game, it's <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BRHYi.jpg"">mentioned that this character</a> was also looking for the IBN 5100 (the non-conical 8-bit version of the game gets more in depth into his motvations). </p>

<p>Kurisu explained the ""Time Leap Machine"" concept to Okabe using NOZOMI papers from <em>Chaos;Head</em>.</p>

<p>On big TV outdoors, FES's performance can be seen in the Alpha timeline. Giving the right reply to Faris's mail earns the player Ayase's portrait and FES's music, sung by Kanako Itou, which include the <em>Chaos;Head</em> OP, ""Find the Blue."" </p>

<p>There's a Seira-tan cosplay cameo in <em>Steins;Gate</em> as well:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Owtx5.jpg"" alt=""Kururururururrururururururusu-tina!""></p>

<p>Nae from <em>Steins;Gate</em> appears as an adult in <em>Robotics;Note</em>. Daru and Kurisu show up on the Twipo network in <em>Robotics;Note</em> as ""DaSH"".

<ol>
<li>Shouyou found Gintoki in a battlefield.</li>
<li>Shouyou created a school with Gintoki.</li>
<li>Katsura and Takasugi joined the school.</li>
<li>Shouyou and Gintoki entered the class with Shouyou giving Gintoki a book to wipe his ass like shown in the Ginpachi-sensei section of episode 306.</li>
<li>Shouyou's school was labeled as teaching children to overthrow the Bakufu.</li>
<li>As shown in episode 306 flashback, Shouyou stopped some patrol from drawing their swords against Sakata Gintoki, Takasugi Shinsuke and Katsura Koutaro.</li>
<li>Shouyou got arrested but was later released, probably with strict warning that this is his last chance and he must stop teaching. This is where Gintoki is shown crying upon his return.</li>
<li>Shouyou ignored the warning and continued to teach as shown in the flashback where Gintoki said that the Bushidou Shouyou taught and they follows won't be bend by such a thing (the threat).</li>
<li>Shouyou teach again for some years and was then arrested again. This fits with he fact that when Gintoki and friends fought in the war, they are older than when they are in school.</li>
<li>Gintoki and other Shouyou students formed a rebel group to save Shouyou.</li>
<li>The Dragon of Katsurahama, Sakamoto Tatsuma joined the group and act as the fund raiser.</li>
<li>As shown in the flashback where Sakamoto and Gintoki crash landed in a desert planet (it was in the first or second season of the anime, I forget which episode), Sakamoto said that he thinks that fighting is not the only way to protect things he deemed precious. He left the group and formed a trade company.</li>
<li>Sakata Gintoki, Katsura Koutaro and Takasugi Shinsuke got arrested and brought to a hill where Yoshida Shouyou is.</li>
<li>Gintoki chose to kill Yoshida Shouyou, his teacher, to save Takasugi and Katsura. His head was indeed returned to Gintoki. The setting might differs but the essence of the story is the same.</li>
</ol>

<p>As for Takasugi losing his eyes to Oboro, it indeed differs from what shown before. Most likely it is because of both Sunrise and Gorilla-sensei didn't think about it when the scene was made. Which is also confirmed by Gintoki in the Ginpachi-sensei section of episode 306.</p>

Quality changes are just because this anime exists for about 15 years, so it's only natural for the video quality itself to improve over time.
Edit: In the anime, the change between old One Piece and new One Piece is alot more clear than in the manga. The quality of the animation started being alot better after One Piece moved to Bandai Entertainment.</p>

<p>Yes there are big changes.
Episodes 517+ happen in a time called ""post-timeskip"" and in ""the new world"".
Episodes 1-516 are referred as ""pre-timeskip"", because after episode 400 alot of big things happen, and they change the whole world of One Piece, but I'm not going to spoil your experience, I can just tell you this: enjoy the East Blue saga, expect big things and surprises, and have fun.</p>

<p>They pretty much admit to this using Gintoki to explain at the end of episode 306, where they include another Ginpachi-Sensei segment.  They even use the point you mention that previously it looked as if Gin joined Shuoyou's school after Katsura and Takasugi, when in the latest episodes it appears to be the reverse.  They make a joke about it not having a script at the time and that something entirely different is happening.  </p>

<p>This is probably as close to an offcial answer that we'll get.</p>

<p>There may be other mentions to why the other points you make out have changed in-between episodes but no mention of this (even as a joke) has appeared in the manga as far as I remember.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Perhaps ""Disappearance of Nagato Yuki"" is a parallel universe to the main series. Here's why: remember how Nagato gave Kyon a choice between the changed world and the original world? It was only because of that choice that allowed Kyon to fix everything to what it was again. However, what if that choice wasn't given to him? What if Nagato decided not to give Kyon the choice of reverting everything back to the original world? This TV series is the result. </p>

"20994","2","","20981","2015-04-21 05:45:12","","7","","<p>The show's existence is in itself a spoiler for <em>The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya,</em> so anyone who hasn't seen the movie/read the book yet has been warned.</p>

<p><em>Yuki-chan</em> is a spinoff anime based on a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Disappearance_of_Nagato_Yuki-chan"" rel=""noreferrer"">manga</a> that began in 2009. The series is written by the original author of the <em>Haruhi</em> series, Nagaru Tanigawa, and takes place in the alternate universe created during the events of <em>Disappearance,</em> in which the members of the SOS Brigade are simply normal humans, and the SOS Brigade doesn't even exist. </p>

<p>The spin-off focuses more on the day-to-day interactions between the characters than the original series, and follows the titular Yuki-chan as she attempts to pursue Kyon, on whom she has a crush. As the series progresses, Yuki-chan develops a friendship with Kyon as she attempts to confess to him, which leads me to believe that the series is non-canon, as the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqVA0GFOqZQ"" rel=""noreferrer"">following conversation</a> takes place in <em>Disappearance</em> shortly after Kyon finds himself in the alternate universe (around 3:17 in the link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Nagato, tell me ... do you know ... who I am?""</p>
  
  <p>""I do. [...] I know that you're a student in class 5. I see you every now and then. But I don't know any more than that.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The spin-off can't take place before the events of <em>Disappearance</em> because <em>Disappearance</em> Yuki only knows Kyon from when he helped her get a library card, and it can't take place afterward because </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Nagato had actually used her powers to rewrite the world and take away all supernatural elements surrounding Haruhi, not just create an alternate universe, and she reverts the change at the end of the story, erasing <em>Disappearance</em> Yuki and the rest of the <em>Disappearance</em> SOS Brigade from existence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The series is thus probably non-canon, and doesn't fit into any specific place in the timeline.</p>

<p>Its plot is basically separated from that of the original series, so it can be watched independently with almost full plot comprehension. However, enjoyment of the characters and their actions might requires familiarity with the source material because the much of the show's appeal stems from <a href=""http://whatjapanthinks.com/2010/01/17/gap-moe-alluring-discordance/"" rel=""noreferrer"">gap moe</a>, in which a perceived difference or contradiction in a person's behavior or action (i.e. ""gap"") is found to be cute or attractive. <em>Yuki-chan</em> lets viewers see the normally stoic Nagato express her feelings as a normal, shy girl, and without this contrast the show turns into another ""cute girls doing cute things"" anime - not that there's anything wrong with those.</p>

"14295","2","","14287","2014-10-03 22:36:12","","7","","<p>I've read the first six or so novels, covering up to the end of the OVAs for the first anime series. [Note: now I've read them all, so I've edited to reflect that.] There aren't any major plot differences between the novels and anime, but there is lots of extra material in the novels that could be interesting for big fans of the anime. I'll spoiler-tag major stuff. Some of this material is also in the manga, which has an official US release, although I'm not too familiar with the manga, so I can't say how much.</p>

<p>The first few novels follow the same plot arc as the anime, with Kyousuke discovering Kirino's otaku secrets and helping her meet Saori and Kuroneko, while also dealing with their parents and Ayase. The main difference is that the novels are narrated in the first person by Kyousuke, so we get to hear his reasons for some of his more inexplicable actions (for example, his screaming bout with his father that was in Episode 3 of the anime was, in the novels, depicted as a product of utter terror and desperation, whereas it looked sort of calculated in the anime). </p>

<p>There are a few extra stories in these novels that weren't adapted to anime, like one where Kyousuke buys Manami a present. The first major difference is the novel-writing storyline, which is almost completely different between the novels and the anime. In the novels, </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> the woman who was Kirino's editor in the anime is actually a failed novelist herself, who steals Kirino's work and passes it off as her own. Kyousuke and Kuroneko infiltrate the publisher using Saori's connections and expose the plagiarism, after which she becomes Kirino's editor as in the anime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kirino's novel is never turned into anime as it was in the anime series. Kuroneko has a much bigger part in this story than in the corresponding anime story, which I enjoyed as a Kuroneko fan. The earlier Christmas date story also has a slightly different emotional payoff than in the anime.</p>

<p>In the novels' equivalent to Series I, Episode 11, Kuroneko actually finishes showing her picture drama about Kyousuke and Kirino's relationship. Not only is it one of the funniest scenes in the novels, it also explains Kuroneko's behavior towards Manami after she starts attending Kyousuke's school.</p>

<p>The anime's ""good"" ending doesn't happen in the novels; only the ""true"" ending, where Kirino flies off to the United States, happens in the novels. </p>

<p>I have now read the novels that cover the second series, and the Sakurai subplot, a major subplot explaining</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> why Kyousuke changed to his current ""take it easy"" persona, causing Kirino and Manami's confrontation and Kirino's hatred for Manami, as shown in Episode 13 of Series II</p>
</blockquote>

<p>was not adapted to the anime. This subplot takes up most of the eleventh novel and contains a scene of temporary peace between </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Kirino and Manami, wherein Kirino even helps out at Manami's family's shop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During this scene, Kyousuke recounts how when he and Manami were in elementary school, he</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> had a meddlesome, class president-like personality that led him to expend a bunch of energy getting a delinquent and nascent otaku, Sakurai, who of course is another cute girl otaku, to come to class. Kyousuke convinced Sakurai to come on their class trip, where he led her up a dangerous mountain peak. Sakurai fell off and was seriously injured; her parents blamed Kyousuke and moved her to a different school, and they didn't see each other again, until Kyousuke seeks her out to apologize in the present. After this incident, Manami convinced Kyousuke to stop being so meddlesome. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This led to the incidents between Kirino and Manami, and later Kirino and Kyousuke, that we see from Kirino's perspective in Series II, Episode 13&mdash;which is not in the novels.
The events it covers are implied, but never explicitly shown; in particular, the anime offers a definitive explanation of Kirino's love for little sister eroge, which we didn't get in the novels as far as I can remember. </p>

<p>It's debatable how much you're really missing by not getting the subplot from the novels; I found it to be a huge, bloated digression that added very little to the anime's much shorter overview of the events, and it</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> adds yet another confession to the string of love confessions that Kyousuke rejects due to his relationship with Kirino, when Sakurai confesses to Kyousuke sometime between his confessions from Ayase and Kanako.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disappointingly (especially for Kuroneko fans), the controversial ending of the anime is an exact adaptation of the novels' ending, so don't expect the novels to save you from that disappointment. (In fact, it's weird how many of the anime's worst moments are direct adaptations of the novel.)</p>

<p>In general, the side characters are integrated into the novel more thoroughly and relationships are explored at greater depth. We get little mentions of things like the relationship between Kyousuke and Rock (Manami's little brother), or between Kuroneko and Ayase. There are also some side stories that shed extra light on certain characters (including Hinata Gokou, Kuroneko's middle sister; Kouhei and Sena Akagi; and Mikagami, who posed as Kirino's fake boyfriend in Series II) and show us things that happened offscreen in the anime, or outside the main timeframe. There's even a crossover story between Ore Imo and To Aru Kagaku no Railgun, where Kirino and Mikoto meet on a talk show while Kyousuke and Touma Kamijou hang out backstage. There's a lot of good humor and interesting exploration of the characters in this extra material. </p>

<p>While reading the novels, it's pretty easy to see why all of these things were cut from the anime; the Sakurai subplot introduces a not-very-significant new character at the last minute, and I found the anime version of the main plot perfectly intelligible without it. The rest has nothing to do with the main plot, and is mostly of interest to hardcore fans. I wouldn't say you're not missing anything by skipping the novels, but you're not missing anything <em>essential</em>&mdash;you can get about 90% of the Ore Imo experience, including 99% of the bad parts, with just the anime.</p>

<li>...the show does get psychologically creepy and sexually suggestive, and these themes aren't exactly hard to miss.</li>

<p>I'm lead to believe this because a comment from <em>atlantiza</em> in this <strong><a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3108/what-is-tks-actual-name"">question</a></strong> says that TK's nonsensical English phrases are song lyrics.</p>

<p>On a side note, there is also a movie called ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" and the ""subtitle"" of the Cowboy Bebop movie was ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"".</p>

<p>I was looking to see if the pose was a parody of anyone and discovered that the <strong><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856796/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">12th episode</a></strong> of Angel Beats is called ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"", which according to the IMDb trivia, <em>is</em> named after the song. So I think that the pose is all TK.</p>

<p>The quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>TK:</strong> <em>[fighting the shadow monsters]</em> Knockin' on Heaven's Door. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Hinata:</strong> Hold on a minute. That's Bob Dylan. </p>

I've seen that in a lot of animes, sometimes it's in one ova episode and sometimes it's in 3 or more. I can put a few down like Rumbling Hearts and the Clannad series.</p>

<p>The reason I think this is cause in disappearance of Haruhi, Haruhi wasn't acting like her usually crazy self and was way more calm because of the change but in Yuki Haruhi is a little more crazy than even the original show. So I think it's more of a what-if thing. Forget the name of the category but there's a name for it. All I remember there the word red in the name. Also, Yuki herself is completely different too and we also forgot about Ryoko she was the same in the movie a crazy killer and kills Kyon (kind of). But in the disappearance of Yuki she's more like a normal girl who likes people and is Kyon's friend.</p>

<p>I feel like many of the stories in this series are too incomplete, as in, lacking any story/development - it almost seems as if the producer is just making up some random nonsensical stuff in an attempt you scare you off.</p>

<p>But maybe the stories presented do have a background story - like a reference to a well-known ghost story or something.</p>

<p>Some of the stories presented do seem to be somewhat self-contained. For instance, the third episode, ""Family Rule"", does explain the situation (the adults are offering their own laughter to please an evil spirit), but other stories don't explain what's going on (for instance, the photocopier episode - there's just this ghost haunting a photocopier, but we don't know why, or what for, etc).</p>

<p>Are the Yami Shibai horror stories based on something, or are they just made up for this series?</p>

<p>They might be well-known Japanese stories, but I don't know much about japanese culture so I'm not sure.</p>

<ol>
<li>For example, Rayleigh swam from the Grand Line through the Calm Belt to reach the Amazon's Island.  </li>
<li>Skypieans have been shown to have flying devices and shells that could propel.  </li>
<li>Amazons have been shown to use creatures to pull the boats.  </li>
<li>Blackbeard's boat is just a giant raft, implying they just use a sail and row. (Given the strength of the characters in this class, chances are that there were a lot of rowing involved)</li>
<li>Franky came up with Coup de Burst, which also lets them cross vast distances quickly.  </li>
<li>Several subs have been shown so far including Wapol, and the Heart Pirates indicating travel without need for waves. The Marines probably have access to this tech (at least, Z's Neo Marines did).  </li>
<li>More importantly, several fruits aid in propulsion. Ace used fire to power his skateboat.  Whitebeard could probably just cause waves even in the Calm Belt to propel his ships (and quite fast I might add, based on wave size and speed).  Dragon (though not confirmed how) was the reason for the gust of wind that helped Straw Hats escape from Loguetown. He may be using similar methods. Dragon also used to have Bartholomew Kuma, who can repel things and land them anywhere in the world.    </li>

Zero</em></a> is a complementary series which tells the story of the characters before timeline of the main series.</p>

<p>You should read <em>Akame ga KILL!</em> if you want to continue from the anime.</p>

<hr>

<p>The story is generally the same up to episode 17/chapter 33. However, the anime begins to have minor deviations from the manga from episode 18/chapter 34. After chapter 38, which corresponds to episode 19, the anime totally skips more than 10 chapters starting from chapter 39, except for this plot point in chapter 43, where</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Susanoo died fighting Esdeath to let the rest of the Night Raid escape. Originally, this happened during the mission to assassinate Borick, which spans from chapter 40 to chapter 43. In the anime, Susanoo's death is moved to episode 21 instead, and Borick's assassination is trivialized at the end of episode 19.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Episode 20 restarts from second half of chapter 50, but doesn't follow the manga too closely, since the manga introduces many new characters during the Wild Hunt arc (from chapter 44 to 48), and several of them affect the story beyond Wild Hunt arc.</p>

<p>Most of the differences between manga and anime adaptation come from this 10-chapter gap.</p>

<p>If you have time, I suggest that you scan through the manga from the beginning, so that you won't miss any details that might have been omitted from the anime adaptation. Otherwise, <strong>chapter 39 is a good place to pick up the manga</strong>.</p>

<p>However, I notice that the track that plays immediately <em>after</em> the theme song in 2014 episode 15 is the same one as the one that plays during the 2014+ previews.</p>

<p>If this is the track that you are referring to, then the name of the song is</p>

<p>It is track 1 on disk 1 of the album ""Fairy Tail Sound Collection"" by Yasuharu Takanashi (the fifth original soundtrack for Fairy Tail if you don't count the movie soundtrack).</p>

<p>I believe that I have supplied enough information for you to look up the track. I am hesitant to link to a Youtube video because I have noticed that Fairy Tail OST videos get taken down due to copyright violations very quickly and frequently so I don't want to provide an invalid link.</p>

That is to say... To be continued！This work will continue! Please wait for the follow-up. Later on, [we'll] release BD privileged information! #buddycom"" (「【バディ・コンプレックス】TOKYO MXにて第13話をご覧頂きました皆様、ありがとうございました！という事で・・・To be continued！本作品はまだ続きます！続報をお待ち下さいませ。この後BD特典情報を公開します！ #buddycom」)</p>

<p>There is <strong>no mention or implication</strong> within the text that indicates any particular set <strong>length of running time</strong>, nor even the <strong>media type</strong> of the promised follow-up. 「作品」 (<em>sakuhin</em>) is a non-specific word for a work of some sort, such as a production, a piece of art, a piece of work, handiwork, even someone's opus.</p>

<p>Thus, the 2014/10/27 post on the official <a href=""http://www.buddy-complex.jp/news.php"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a> announcing the <a href=""http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%90%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9#Blu-ray"" rel=""nofollow"">完結編</a> (<em>kanketsuhen</em>, the last program of a series), which was released November 21st, 2014 and comprised of a two-parter 前編 (<em>zenpen</em>, first part) and 後編 (<em>kouhen</em>, second [after] part), does not in any way conflict with the original Twitter announcement. This means that, no, <strong>a second season of TV anime was not scheduled and then cancelled</strong>. 「完結編」 (<em>kanketsuhen</em>), by its very meaning, is the last program of a series; to title a release that way is to <strong>explicitly state that there are no plans for ever produce a following work</strong> such as a second TV anime season.</p>

<p>Therefore, it does not seem that proficient readers of Japanese would have misunderstood the tweet to promise a season's worth of upcoming anime. Someone who reported on the tweet in English for an English-language source seems to have jumped to a conclusion regarding in what sense the 「作品」 (<em>sakuhin</em>) would continue. </p>

The finale was released in September 2014. The finale announcement article also concludes with the same note that ""the story will still continue"" but this seems to be more copy-pasted from the first announcement than an actual announcement (it links back to the same old Twitter post).</p>

<p>Why did Buddy Complex not get a full second season? Was a second season scheduled and then reduced to two episodes because of poor sales or anything like that? Is another season still planned?

Maybe he really liked  Akame and gave her the title name, maybe he's reading these websites and is looking for the best reason as to why he put her name on the title or he likes people thinking about his characters and make conspiracy theroies about them.</p>

I'll stick to recurring characters and exclude filler arcs, as I haven't watched those. For the exact episode numbers refer to <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Arcs"">this page</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to skip to where <em>all the big badass characters like Ace and WhiteBeard are involved</em> you should <strong>skip to the Marineford Arc</strong>. In that arc you will see an all-out war going down between Whitebeard and the Marines to save Ace. I would recommend you to <strong>start at the Sabaody Archipelago Arc</strong> though, where a lot of new characters were introduced that will recur in the story. You could skip inbetween arcs if you want. If you would do so, you'd only have missed the introduction of Franky and Brook and the backstory on Robin.</p>

<p>If you've just watched the anime and want to get into the manga without repeating material, you can probably start with Volume 5. It might also help to read Volume 4. Volume 5 seems to be the cutoff point where the anime ends, but there are some differences in how the material of Volumes 4 and 5 is presented in the anime versus the original manga.</p>

<h1>The Evidence</h1>

<p>It's shocking how hard it is to find info in English on anything other than mega-hits like Naruto. For that reason, this answer isn't perfectly definitive, but this question deserves some kind of answer, so here's what my efforts produced.</p>

<p>I just finished watching the anime and I did a little poking through some scanlations to try and establish the timeframe. Based on my random sampling, nhahtdh is correct that the anime version ends in Volume 5 of the manga; Chapter 22 is the first chapter of Volume 5, and it contains a version of the scene from Episode 11 when Yuki and Hajime meet at the family restaurant to discuss the incident from sixth grade. </p>

<p>However, <a href=""http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%80%E9%80%B1%E9%96%93%E3%83%95%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BA%E3%80%82#.E5.90.84.E8.A9.B1.E3.83.AA.E3.82.B9.E3.83.88"" rel=""nofollow"">this chart from Japanese Wikipedia</a> claims that Episodes 11 and 12 are covered in Volume 4. Some scenes in the anime seem to be composites of scenes from the manga, so that might make it more of a ""Well, yeah, XX from the anime was in Volume 5, but the bulk of material from those episodes was in Volume 4"" sort of thing. For example, the scene with Hajime and Yuki ends totally differently from the anime; they don't meet up with the girls who</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> bullied Kaori, causing her to run into the street and get hit and triggering her memory loss</p>
</blockquote>

<p>nor does</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Kaori show up and hear the reason for her memory loss</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as happened in the anime; instead, they go to Yuki's house and play video games together. Also, the scene at the crepe shop from Episode 11 when</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Kaori tells Hajime she probably can't remember him because he was her friend, then sees her ""friends"" from her past who bullied her for ""stealing"" Hajime and gets a tiny flash of memory, causing her to run away, after which Yuki confronts Hajime</p>
</blockquote>

<p>happens in Chapter 18 (Volume 4) under different circumstances.</p>

<p>The anime timeline seems to run ahead of the manga timeline, and as far as I can tell, the pace of the manga is consistently slower than the anime.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Week_Friends#Manga"" rel=""nofollow"">the Wikipedia page</a> (sourced from <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-07-21/one-week-friends-manga-final-volume-ships-in-april-2015/.76876"" rel=""nofollow"">this Anime News Network posting</a>), the manga hasn't ended yet and the final volume will be released in April of 2015, so we don't yet know just how how much the anime actually diverges from the manga. However, the main plot points of the manga up to Chapter 22 seem to be the same as the anime:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Hajime shows up, causing Kaori to lose all her hard-earned memories of Yuki. Yuki gets to work rebuilding those memories while trying to get to the bottom of what happened between Hajime and Kaori in the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, if we look at the dates of release on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Week_Friends#Manga"" rel=""nofollow"">the Wikipedia page</a>, Volume 6 didn't come out until the time the anime was already airing. Volume 5 came out around the time the anime started airing, so assuming the anime production took about six months, the material in Volume 5 was probably the most recent the animators would have had access to when they were creating the series.</p>

<p>Based on all of this, my educated guess is that Episodes 11 and 12 contained anime-original material, but were based on material from the manga wherever possible. Episode 12 just wrapped up too neatly to think otherwise, while also avoiding a conclusive ending and leaving things open for a second season to finish the manga plotline. Notably,</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Kaori and Yuki are still just friends when the anime concludes, and Kaori still loses her memories every week, though she's fought her way back to remembering tidbits about Yuki. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you want to cut in to the manga without repeating material, I would start at Volume 5. According to the MangaFox page, the manga has been licensed (though I can't find any info on which company has it), so we might be seeing an official English release soon.</p>

"134","2","","132","2012-12-12 02:22:36","","6","","<p>At some point in the Fate/Stay Night game, it's revealed that the holy grail can be summoned without having sacrificed all of the necessary servants. The grail won't be all-powerful, but it should still be plenty powerful for most wishes. Because the grail was activated while some of the servants were still alive, it was not at full power, hence the destruction (the only wish it is able to grant in its current corrupted form) is less than what it could be.</p>

<p>Spoilers for F/SN game:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>The fact that the grail wasn't all-powerful and yet still caused so much destruction is why Kotomine sets in motion the events of the 5th grail war. By keeping Gilgamesh and beating the newly summoned servants, Kotomine would be able to see the grail at full power. In fact, six servants would be sufficient for any wish ""within the limits of this world"" (whatever that means), but Kotomine wants to know what would happen with all seven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is also important for at least one F/SN route:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> On the UBW good end, the grail is summoned while both Saber and Archer are present. The fact that Archer is still alive is not known at the time, even to Gilgamesh. In this case, the grail was summoned into an impure vessel as well, because Gilgamesh believes that the more corrupt the vessel, the greater the destruction it can bring.</p>

"2453","2","","2448","2013-02-12 11:41:08","","7","","<p>The place that Himari goes to (with her two brothers) is called the <a href=""http://penguindrum.wikia.com/wiki/Crystal_World"">Crystal World</a>. It's a fantasy world that they get transported to by the <a href=""http://penguindrum.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_of_the_Crystal"">Princess of Crystal</a>, the entity that possesses Himari through the hat. Not sure if it can be considered a hallucination (if it is, it's definitely shared between its occupants), but it's probably not in the physical world, perhaps in a ""dream"" world?</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://penguindrum.wikia.com/wiki/Penguin_Trio"">three penguins</a> were assigned by the Princess of the Crystal to Himari, Shoma and Kanba to help find the Penguindrum. They're not hallucinations since they physically interact with the real world. The reason why only the 3 who were assigned penguins could see them isn't explained.</p>

<p>As for <strong>B</strong>, I don't think you can look at any of this as ""godlike"" or ""cosmic power"". This is purely fantasy so it doesn't make sense to apply the series in a real-world like setting. These powers are fantastic beyond explanation and the entire series is heavily laden with symbolism.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>The Princess of the Crystal wants the Penguindrum and in return, Himari can be saved. At the end of the series, it's revealed that the Penguindrum was actually the apple that Kanba and Shoma shared while in cages when they were little (the ""fruit of fate""). So the two boys give up their ""fate"" to the Princess of the Crystal, thus giving up their entire existence, resulting in a Himari that is alive and well in a world where the two boys never existed. The sacrifice was giving up their fate to the Princess of the Crystal, who isn't a god or cosmic power, but turns out is part of Momoka Oginome's soul, Ringo's older sister and the original owner of the diary (she died from that terrorist attack). Her soul was split into two and became the two penguin hats, one of them being the one that Himari was given.</p>

What i mean by that is the person who created Trigun put a black cat in the episode in memory of a cat that was loved very much. Most people love the animals they have very much and what better way to keep the memory alive by putting a drawing of it in your show? I personally think that this makes the most sense.</p>

  <p>The way they threw random words of other actual languages into their made up language was
  very funny, especially if you understand Japanese (how foreign words are

<p>I tracked these down by just going to page 1 of that thread then searching for the word ""language"". It seems the general consensus is it is gibberish and that it is a mixture of words.

<p>My first impression was that the writer had no idea how to resolve the fundamental questions of the plot, and thus had to throw out completely unresolvable symbolism in order to fake an ending.
A few of my driving questions throughout the series were as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A recurring motif of the show is that the main character would get possessed by a penguin hat, and pull one or two characters into a kind of alternate reality where they were handcuffed.  To what degree was this a hallucination?  Likewise, Penguins 1, 2, and 3, plus the additional penguin, were important characters who were not visible to most people in the show.  To what degree were they hallucinations, and to what degree were they paranormal?  </p></li>
<li><p>Were there any forces in the story that were godlike, in that they were both powerful and capable of passing judgement on mortals?  In particular, at the end of the show, it seems that two boys sacrificed their mortal lives for the sake of two girls.  Was this a sacrifice made to a god or other cosmic power?</p></li>

<p>When Hisashi was attacked, he had a layer of clothing protecting him. So it's safe to say that the bite didn't get very deep penetration. Hence why he was able to last the entire episode (several hours)?</p>

<p>Oh the other hand, Tejima-sensei from earlier in the first episode took a large bite directly on his naked arm. He was zombified almost instantly (under 1 minute).</p>

<p>Chapter 42 picks off with S Class hero, King (ranked 7) <em>facing off</em> a reptile monster and then, Dushimof, a machine god created by the Organisation.</p>

The show was made in that order and cues in later episodes (even if set in the past) will have no effect if you haven't seen what they're referencing from a previous ep.</p>

<p>However, for everyone else that, like me, rocked up at this question because you're generally curious about what the actual order might be <sup>(instead of just being ushered away with <em><code>don't you worry about that</code></em>)</sup>, I'm writing this for you.<br/>
This is no Haruhi, but I don't doubt that it'd be cool to go chronological for a rewatch of the show, get a new perspective and watch the characters grow together.</p>

<p>So, if you want to follow the story of the anime read the first title you posted, the Zero version is a prequel which introduces some characters which may or may not be met again in the principal storyline. </p>

<li>Improved technology.</li>
<li>HD quality came much later, maybe around 2005.</li>
<li>Although the episode length is the same (23 minutes), the size has increased (60 MB and more), though it is because of HD quality.</li>

  <p>After Archer’s victory, this vessel had finally absorbed the soul of the fourth Servant. [...]</p>
  
  <p>The corpse of the beautiful homunculus was completely consumed by the heat in the blink of an eye, and was reduced to ashes. That was not all. The golden cup that had contacted the outside air charred the floor and the curtains, and roaring flames enveloped the completely empty stage.</p>
  
  <p>On the stage where the fire was raging ever wilder, the golden cup floated in the air as if it was upheld by a pair of invisible hands. The ceremony of the descent of the Holy Grail, which the Three Noble Families of the Beginning had desired so much, had begun silently even without the presence of a priest</p>
