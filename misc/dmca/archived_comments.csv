"11062","2675","0","I like both series. They each have their goods and bads. Index has a bit more of a convoluted and involved storyline, due to the encounters with magic and science, but is very funny in the ways that Touma interacts with Index. Railgun is more straight forward and clear cut. It is very action packed but is also funny. So, watch both.","2014-04-24 20:15:45","user4647","","user4647"

Oda intended this to be included in the manga but cut it in order to have them get to the grand line by the 100th chapter.  The key glasses Usopp aquires here are retained in canon and it clearly shows his remarkable sniper skills more than anywhere else prior to that point in the series.
