My question is: is Byakuya *really* dead, here, or does he come back and whatnot? This scene *looks* as though he is, but we've seen desperate situations-like this-in the past chapters (or episodes) of Bleach where the character isn't **truly** dead; they come back later making a dramatic entrance, looking even more badass than before.

But the Marine and some advanced Pirate crews/ alianzes  commute daily between the oceans. To be more specific here are a few questions who say what I mean:

 1. The marine travels between every oceans they want. By using seastone on their ships they can easily travel thought the Calm Belt and switch between the Grand Line/ New World and all Blues. Because the marine is a member of the World Goverment they also can pass the Red Line thought Mary Joa. But the Seastone techniqe (Episode 410) is a new Invention from Dr. Vegapunk. How did the marine travel so easy thougth the Clam Belt before that. [Here][1] an example: How get a World Goverment ship from the Grandline to Eastblue before 10 years when there wasn't this new Seastone techniqe.

 2. How Shakes and Whitebeard daily switch between the Grandline and the Blues? In [Luffy's past][2] Shakes was in the East Blue. In the [Battle of Marine Ford][3] again in Grandline etc. Same as Whitebeard. One time Whitebead what in the Grandline, [then][4] in the Eastblue and then again in the Grand Line etc. **Does Whitebead, Shanks and other Pirates also use Seastone as the marine?**

 3. And what about Monkey D. Dragon? [One time][5] Dragon was in the East Blue. [Here][6] he was again in the Grand Line.

So I hope you see what my question is. I'm especially wondering about the daily switching between the Grand Line/ New World and Blues. As I know the only way to enter to the Grand Line is Reverse Mountain, which isn't the most harmless way as you can see in [episode 61][7]. Does that mean that Whitebeard and Shanks every time when they want to go to the Grand Line they pass with thier gigant ships this small rivers?

Apart from the gettin to the Grand Line, how do they leave the Grand Line/ New World? According to the [maps][8] there is no way to get out. How did [Krieg][9] left the Grand Line?

However, the Marines and some advanced pirate crews/alliances commute daily between the oceans. To be more specific, here are a few examples to demonstrate what I mean:

 1. The Marines travels between every oceans they want. By using Seastone on their ships, they can easily travel through the Calm Belt and switch between the Grand Line/New World and all Blues. Because the Marines is a member of the World Government, they can also pass the Red Line via Mary Joa.

   However, the Seastone technique (Episode 410) is a new invention from Dr. Vegapunk. How did the Marines travel through the Calm Belt so easy before that? Another example in [episode 502-503][1]: How did a World Government ship travel from the Grand Line to East Blue 10 years ago when Seastone technique hadn't been invented?

 2. In [Luffy's past][2], Shanks was in the East Blue, then in the [Battle of Marine Ford][3], he was again in Grand Line, etc.

  Same for Whitebeard. One time, Whitebead was in the Grand Line, [then][4] in the East Blue, and then again in the Grand Line, etc.

  How do Shanks and Whitebeard manage to travel between the Grand Line and the Blues on daily basis? **Do Whitebead, Shanks and other Pirates also use Seastone like the Marines?**

 3. And what about Monkey D. Dragon? [One time][5], Dragon was in the East Blue. [Here][6], he was again in the Grand Line.

So I hope you see what my question is. I'm especially curious about the daily switching between the Grand Line/New World and Blues. As I know, the only way to enter the Grand Line is via the Reverse Mountain, which isn't the most harmless way as you can see in [episode 61][7]. Does that mean that every time Whitebeard and Shanks want to go to the Grand Line, they have to pass this small river with their gigantic ships?

Apart from getting to the Grand Line, how do they leave the Grand Line/New World? According to the [maps][8], there is no way to get out. How did [Krieg][9] leave the Grand Line?

 * This is a wild guess, but Girls Dead Monster might actually be a homage to Dead Girls, a four-girl music group in the *Red Garden* OVA. Granted, it is a [common team combination][13], but there are two more similarities between the two music groups: a former band member of GirlDeMo, Iwasawa, passed away (the second time) and left the team; a former schoolmate of the members of Dead Girls, Lise, who was murdered together with the four girls, also passed away (the second time) and left the team. Moreover, the demon, what Otonashi calls a [""monster""][14], that Hisako turned into resembles the [monsters][15] in *Red Garden*.

I googled a bit and came across [this link](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/2000121-anime-and-manga-other-titles/69737130), according to which ***Akame ga Kill*** literally means:

> Akame *is* kill 

So what does that even mean? Does it mean that Akame is Death itself, or Akame is Dead (Not physically, but mentally - that she is dead inside). But I doubt that either of these interpretations are correct since she acts all cutesy from time to time.

As another user points out, a general translation would be *Akame Kills*, but that would be a very stupid name, wouldn't it? So can anyone help clear this up?

I know it doesn't mean ""Yamada's first time"", the title that Funimation gave the show for the US release. According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Gata_H_Kei), the literal translation is ""Type: B, Style: H"". Some episodes of the show imply that ""B"" is a reference to the main character, Yamada's, bust size, and ""H"" is a reference to her ""ecchi"" nature. Where does the rest of it (the ""Type"", ""Style"" part) fit in, or is it just meaningless?"

However, it seems that Miyafuji is still not that famous. I assume then that *the events of Brave Witches start in the middle of Strike Witches Season 1*.

So far what I could see in the series that they were reading is the following:

1. 1984 -George Orwell
2. A revolution sabotaged before it began  -Yasumi Iwakura
3. Swann's way - Marcel Proust
4. Holy Bible

I know they have other references and books shown in the series, does anybody have a more complete list? I have read some of these but I'm curious about.

Below are my research as I post this question.

---
According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoyu#Light_novels), the original light novel series has finished serialization in 2012 with 8 volumes in total:

> - 01 *“Become My property, Hero” “I Refuse!”* (「この我のものとなれ、勇者よ」「断る!」)
> - 02 *Conspiracy of Kurultai* (忽鄰塔（クリルタイ）の陰謀)
> - 03 *Expeditionary force of Seiken* (聖鍵（せいけん）遠征軍)
> - 04 *What Can be Done With These Hands* (この手でできること)
> - Episode 01 *Episode1 Female Magician from Elms country* (エピソード1 楡の国の女魔法使い)
> - 05 *The other side of the hill* (あの丘の向こうに)
> - Episode 00 *Episode0 Archer from Dune country* (エピソード0 砂丘の国の弓使い)
> - Episode 02 *Episode2 Female Knight from Flowers country* (エピソード2 花の国の女騎士)

The 3 ""episodes"" are likely side stories (or prequel?) to the main story. That makes the whole of main story contained within 5 volumes.

The last episode of the anime doesn't seem to suggest that the story has ended (rather, it seems to plant seeds for future events):

>! The Central Nation and the Church is going to start the third Holy Crusade, and it was revealed that the Central Nation and the Church has been working with one of the Demonic Clans to keep the war going.

---
>! Maou called for meeting of all Greater Races (クリルタイ), but how the meeting plays out is not mentioned. Knowing how the expectation of the Demonic Races and Maou's philosophy to be mismatched, we can assume that the meeting has not taken place.

**""クリルタイ""** is mentioned in the last episode, which is part of the title of volume 2 of light novel series (忽鄰塔（**クリルタイ**）の陰謀). This seems to suggest that the 12 anime episodes only uses up 1 volume worth (!) of the light novel series."

 1. Is it on the hiatus right after  episode 277(counting from 2014, 102)?

Death Parade is an anime that's about a place after life, where you are send to nowhere (hell) or you are going to be reincarnation (heaven). So i was wondering, if there was a deeper meening in showing this person. Because after Lights death, it isn't impossible that he is going to be judged in this world.
I am very gratefully for some clear answer :*[![enter image description here][1]][1]

i can't remember where i got it from but i was reminded of that it appeared that some of the made up country names like Fuso and Orassia seemed to resemble that of real world locations such as Japan and Russia.

So i am wondering, in Strike Witches what are all the made up countries and if they have real world counterparts?

NOTE: i should point out that i don't know if the image i have has every country on it. if there are other countries in the Strike Witches Universe then i would like them listed too.

Also, [this][2] track plays in the common route whenever Riki chooses to play with Masato.

For some reason, neither of these tracks can be found in the *Little Busters!* Original Soundtrack - I listened through the entire thing and could not find either of them. 

Is there perhaps another album with these tracks on it? 

Is there a reason these tracks were excluded from the Original Soundtrack, which for all intents and purposes should contain all music used in the game? Did the folks at Key mess up, or were these tracks deemed unworthy of a spot on the soundtrack?  

Can someone find out what either of these are called, or are they just unnamed tracks excluded from the rest of the soundtrack for some reason?

To make this question a bit more concrete: Which episodes are directly based off the manga, and which were produced with unique content for *only* the anime? At what points did the anime ""catch up"" to the manga and require non-manga-related content to continue airing episodes while the manga produced new content?"

But then, only three months later, [a two-episode finale was announced instead][4], seemingly to the [surprise][5] (a reaction of confusion common in other forums as well, which I share) of many. The finale was released in September 2014. The finale announcement article also concludes with the same note that ""the story will still continue"" but this seems to be more copy-pasted from the first announcement than an actual announcement (it links back to the same old Twitter post).

Why did Buddy Complex not get a full second season? Was a second season scheduled and then reduced to two episodes because of poor sales or anything like that? Is another season still planned? I don't know Japanese and so searching for sources was difficult. I'm looking primarily for official news and announcements, interviews, etc.

Or is it completely independent aside from using the same characters - in which case, can it be watched without previously having watched any of the older series?

In the first episode,

>! When Hisashi is bitten by one of 'them', he has a wound for a long time. It takes more than 2 hours for him to finally die.

During the first 9 minutes of episode 3 or 4, there are annotations on the bottom of the screen stating the time of the events that occurred. When we see the scene with Takashi, Hisashi and Rei are running through the school trying to make it through to the roof - you can easily see

>! the wound on Hisashi's arm - which is a bite mark that made him infected, and death inescapable. He coughs and splutters blood, and it takes him from around 1:00 PM to 3:05PM to die.

However, later in the series, you can see that those bitten can also become 'them' instantaneously. For instance,

>! in episode 6 or 7, we see a swarm of 'them' trying to attack the police at the first bridge. A live woman is amongst the crowd pleading to be saved and protected, with her daughter 'alive' in her arms. But the daughter rises as one of 'them' and bites her Mother. For a brief second, you see the Mother in shock - and then only seconds later she turns into one of 'them'.

Is there any real way to tell how long it takes for a live person to turn into 'them'?

I watched that video over and over again, then forgot about it until recently, when I remembered it, recalled how much the art style looked like early Pokemon, and suddenly realized that that was probably the first anime I ever saw.

In preparation to write an id request, I did some searching, and I now think the show I saw was probably [Chiisana Obake Acchi, Kocchi, Socchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ghosts,_There,_Here,_and_Where). The timeframe is right, the plot sounds similar, and the picture seems familiar. The character names listed for the Spanish and Polish dubs on [Anime News Network](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1042) sound familiar and both Anime News Network and [My Anime List](http://myanimelist.net/anime/310/Chiisana_Obake_Acchi_Kocchi_Socchi) give the show the English title *Three Little Ghosts*. Anime News Network even lists English language script staff. But there's nothing under ""English cast"" or ""English companies"", and I can't find any hard evidence that it was actually released in the United States.

Was Chiisana Obake Acchi, Kocchi, Socchi ever released in the US, and if so, when and by whom?"
